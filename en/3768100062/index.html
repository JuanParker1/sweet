it<br>somebody does it for him well<br>i don’t know who’s doing it they’re doing a really good job<br>getting out the information he imagine what his<br>christmas dinner was like he had<br>charlie sheen to talk about he had terrorism to talk about<br>how somehow they connected with each other<br>yeah he’ll probably have something well<br>charlie didn’t do anything who probably<br>it’s the government<br>doesn’t want charlie out there talking about nine eleven<br>i’m half joey diaz half out<br>he knows that<br>that’s i’m too high<br>laser gentlemen i’m too high to be doing this show<br>this is ridiculous<br>it’s the weed that they have here in california is just<br>too goddamn strong ladies and gentlemen it’s medical<br>you can just buy it from a fucking store<br>shit is outrageous<br>and that’s train wreck<br>that’s like one of the best ones you can get<br>i don’t like how you guys are looking down at me<br>makes me uncomfortable<br>i wish we were looking eye to eye on the same level<br>i’m gonna have to set this up<br>so that we’re looking eye to eye<br>feels weird looking up at that thing i need a smaller<br>monitor i can trade it<br>you’re so nice<br>questions question<br>questions let’s go to the rogan board we’re gonna go to<br>to forums jobrogan net to the official twelve twenty nine<br>used stream podcast thread where the questions are not limited<br>to a gay hundred and forty characters actually<br>it’s ridiculous<br>do you think there will be one world government in our life or<br>do you think it would actually affect this<br>i think that’s possible<br>it’s very possible if they can get the money sorted out<br>between all these fucking scumbags that run these<br>world governments yeah<br>they would all agree to one gigantic system of government<br>the problem with one gigantic system<br>of government is though even<br>though it would be harder for corruption<br>it would be it’s also<br>harder to keep people in line because you have to have enemies<br>you have to have like you know<br>the turks hate the fucking iranians hate the this hate of that<br>if you don’t have that conflict<br>it’s very difficult to keep people in line<br>you know and if we were all the united states of america<br>then we started arguing about money<br>we started arguing about taxes we start arguing<br>even if we’re all one thing<br>it makes it very difficult to do<br>but as far as like giant international banks<br>they might already be in cahoots or close<br>enough to one world government i mean there might be a few<br>that are really pulling the strings and running things<br>but i mean<br>it’ll be cool as the future of the government was just<br>the internet so if your time you wanted to vote<br>it was just like going on a message board and voting like hey<br>so we have legal insurance vote now yeah<br>that would be pretty that would be like for the people by then<br>people would hack it<br>yeah you know<br>it’s all good on paper but<br>you know anything that you do on the internet now<br>like dudes you play poker<br>you don’t even know if you’re playing poker against a real dude<br>you know you could easily be playing poking as a computer right<br>i mean i don’t know what kind of programs they run<br>but it seems to me like at this point time<br>people can hack just about anything<br>thinking i mean<br>there’s programs like<br>that’s the problem<br>with these drones they have you heard about this<br>those drones<br>kids are hacking into the drones like the airplanes this<br>drones i check the borders and stuff yeah well<br>they don’t just check borders they launch missiles right<br>they have these fucking things<br>these drones that shoot these things called hellfire missiles<br>and they use them in pakistan<br>and all these places we’re not really supposed to be<br>and they just fly in and jack people well<br>the insurgents have figured out how to hack the code and<br>actually view the monitor it’s crazy shit man<br>speaking of crazy shit i really do have to take a shit<br>we plan this out best<br>i’m gonna take a shit and brian’s gonna answer<br>questions and that’s a twenty nine dollar program<br>that that they use just to hack our videos<br>there is a toilet in his office<br>what is your opinion<br>let’s go get it back to twitter<br>joe doesn’t make the extract listerine packages it’s actually<br>one of the products that’s sold here in california when you<br>have a medical marijuana license<br>you can go to a store<br>and they sell the listerine<br>at the store like looks like listerine strips<br>so now he doesn’t make him himself<br>joe has not seen avatar yet we’re the last two people to<br>see avatar and we’re supposed to see it this week<br>it’s pretty annoying not<br>being the last one to see it<br>underwear bomber was staged any thoughts<br>that dude from the airplane<br>undercovered<br>the government man<br>the government<br>yeah<br>i think he’s just a retard yeah<br>joe just thinks he’s a retard<br>i think it shows you how fragile our system is<br>that one guy to do one stupid thing and the whole world<br>grinds to a halt and security takes five hours now<br>you guys probably didn’t hear that<br>but he thinks it’s pretty ridiculous how<br>one guy did all of that<br>and that’s how bad our security is and now<br>shit’s all fucked up from that one dude<br>joe is not we’re not reading the chat on you stream<br>joe is only doing the twitter<br>so if you want to have a message<br>joe answered if you put on twitter or joe rogan’s website<br>which is forums<br>joe rogan net he’s taking a<br>shit right now so you’ll be right back<br>it’s the coffee sorry it’s the starbucks coffee<br>let’s go back to the<br>all right i’m gonna go read some messages on joe’s website<br>forums jorogan net<br>joe would be right back<br>let’s go<br>almost three hundred<br>yeah i have the dark vader<br>mark echo sweatshirt also<br>but yeah that boba fettle is pretty sweet<br>i have realized though it’s pretty gay when you’re by yourself<br>and not with friends with these sweatshirts<br>there’s the boba fat one<br>where’s oh sweet<br>yeah you

jijitsu<br>and he’s he’s a big video game junkie and<br>he had a bubble fella on it’s pretty dope<br>pretty dope<br>all right<br>questions<br>questions from the twitter world is my twitter tweet deck<br>i couldn’t get to refresh it<br>and i think it’s the api thing again so you might want to close<br>that and use the u stream one only okay<br>see it’s not closed yet just shut off i don’t forget that<br>all right twitter on news drink<br>let’s go with the questions here bitches<br>what am i back in ireland<br>i’m not gonna be back in ireland<br>until the ufc’s back in ireland<br>it’s not<br>financially feasible for me to make those trips without the ufc<br>to the uk but every time i’m there<br>if there’s a show if we’re gonna<br>if we’re doing the ufc in ireland for sure<br>i’ll be doing stay on comedy there<br>they could hear the flesh they could hear me<br>did you hear me take it down<br>it was so strong i couldn’t resist it i knew i had to go<br>i didn’t want to<br>i wanted to i wanted to be able to just man up and<br>push through the whole<br>u stream but i was like i’m gonna do a bad job<br>because i’m gonna just be thinking about this dump<br>i have to take<br>so what we were talking about before<br>i took off because it was kind of important stuff<br>i think the one wrote thing is the last thing you talked oh<br>that was the first question one world government our lifetimes<br>i don’t know man i used to<br>i had a lot more faith before<br>obama got alerted i’ll tell you that<br>i thought that maybe what we had was a corrupt situation<br>and you know that bush and cheney were corrupt in that<br>if we got somebody else in there<br>maybe they could straighten everything out<br>but after obama got elected man<br>it became pretty clear to me that someone<br>else besides the president obviously is pulling the strings<br>obama didn’t want to<br>send more troops obama didn’t want to go to afghanistan<br>to bring more people to afghanistan he wanted to<br>pull out a guantanamo bay<br>and close guantanamo bay down all that shit<br>but<br>it’s not i don’t think he gets to say what the fuck they do or<br>he was just saying that kind of shit to get elected<br>you know i mean<br>the old bill hicks joke comes to mind<br>you know that american politics is<br>you know i like the puppet on the right well<br>i find the puppet to the left to be more at a lot my liking<br>hey wait a minute there’s one guy’s holding both puppets<br>i think it’s right what are you doing oh<br>it’s not doing anything<br>i’m just i know<br>but you’re just tracking the shit out of me i just<br>you can pick up clothes in the screen moving shit around<br>fucking psycho<br>he’s a tweaker<br>but not like the meth kind like yesterday<br>come on let’s optimize my internet<br>he’s the kind of dude he<br>hacks into his registry to make his internet<br>like one kbh faster<br>you’re one of those dudes right<br>you remember when computers first came out and<br>i had the friend<br>that said that he could hack into the library and like<br>get rid of all the doofies<br>and stuff like that i was wondering if that was real<br>if he was just pointing my lego<br>well definitely<br>there were some systems that you could hack into<br>if you were a wizard<br>you know isn’t that what<br>well mitnick did a lot of shit with like phone calls right<br>didn’t he like get information from people<br>yeah like it wasn’t even that he was like this great hacker<br>it was just he was kind of like a con man<br>by the way did you read that they<br>just<br>hacked the like the twenty one year old code<br>that scrambles our phone calls on cell phones so now<br>and the guys<br>the hackers put it on the internet so anyone could have it<br>so now i mean of course<br>it’s probably not gonna happen to us anytime soon but<br>now there’s actually<br>people that have the code to that they can listen to your phone<br>listen to your phone calls holy shit<br>but the twenty one year old code like a sixty four bit code<br>i think that’s where the world is headed to<br>i think that’s where<br>i think that’s the future<br>the future is there’s not going to be any private information<br>i think what we’re seeing with like this tiger woods thing<br>i think we’re seeing the future of things to come<br>i mean with him it’s obviously that he’s a celebrity<br>and it’s<br>but the way that everybody is swarming after this information<br>me too man i can’t fucking put down on us weekly<br>if i seen us weekly at the market<br>and there’s some new tiger ones information<br>i grab that i can’t fucking help it<br>you know well<br>i think eventually<br>there’s not going to be any secrets i think eventually<br>we’re going to get to a point<br>where the way information<br>is being distributed it’s changing the way<br>we feel about information<br>i mean it’s a weird<br>with celebrities it’s one thing you know we’re looking at it<br>like well these are famous people<br>and you know it’s like they give up that right<br>once once you start<br>you know put yourself in the public eye<br>you give up that right to privacy well<br>eventually that’s gonna happen<br>like it’s happening with facebook accounts too like<br>girls are doing stupid shit<br>and their facebook accounts and it gets all the internet<br>and they go well<br>you know she gave up her right when she put it on facebook<br>it’s like that new google goggles<br>where you can just take a photo of anything<br>and it<br>figures out what it is and then searches it for you<br>so you can now<br>like go to a like<br>if you see like a can of pop right<br>you can take a picture of it and knows what it is<br>google is it but you can it’s starting to get where you can<br>they’re going to do it<br>where you can do<br>flowers and plants and anything so pretty soon<br>everything’s going to be google searched so<br>there is no privacy so while i’m here i could<br>you know what i mean like<br>yeah yeah i mean eventually<br>i’m sure that shit is gonna make its way into your house well<br>it’s already is google goggles came out on the hand droid no<br>but i mean i mean you’ll be able to search someone’s house oh<br>yeah take a photo and you’ll be able to go oh<br>this guy lives at ninety seven woodcrest road right people<br>alomia five years ago you put a picture on your facebook<br>a christmas photo that has like your bookshelf<br>in the background<br>present day that’s gonna<br>start researching every single book that’s on your shelf<br>and it’s gonna put in a database somewhere in a gps location<br>you know what<br>i mean so like when you’re searching for something<br>you could be like oh<br>joe has that book at home<br>i think what’s happening i think what’s happening with twitter<br>and what’s happening with facebook<br>and what’s happening with the<br>just the internet in general is there’s way<br>more<br>connectivity between all human beings and a part of that is<br>access to information<br>so that information is not going to be like it is now<br>it’s not going to be private i think no do you<br>i think eventually<br>technology will come to the point where<br>lying will be absolutely impossible<br>and you will know everything that everybody else knows<br>and everyone’s gonna try to hold back on it for a while<br>because people have a lot of dirty secrets<br>and they do a lot of creepy shit<br>but i think ultimately<br>it’s probably gonna be good for everybody<br>i do<br>think that that’s where we’re headed i think<br>we’re headed to a point<br>where everybody<br>has access to<br>all the information that everybody else has<br>and not just like<br>like you go in the internet and you search for it<br>not like in a rudimentary way<br>we have to actively look for it<br>i think it’s going to be right there<br>i think there’s going to eventually come<br>there’s going to eventually get to a point<br>where there’s some<br>sort of technology that’s created that allows<br>human minds to interface with other human minds<br>i think that that’s definitely where this is all going<br>i mean when there’s talk of neural<br>implants and all these different things<br>people think that’s all crazy but<br>that’s a small step<br>from where we are<br>in comparison and where we were just a couple hundred years ago<br>i mean a couple hundred years ago<br>the fastest motive transportation was riding a fucking animal<br>think about that<br>you had to write three hundred years ago<br>the fastest shit on land is to ride an animal<br>or have an animal pull you behind something with wheel or slave<br>yeah<br>but slaves can’t run as fast as animal some of those guys can<br>no way not of course<br>this guy’s an idiot can’t believe he does<br>but i mean think about what a monument elite between<br>the transference of information<br>today in two thousand nine<br>and in seventeen o nine<br>i mean think about what we can do right now<br>we could send a fucking picture<br>across you know space<br>send it through the air<br>and it literally arrives i mean if i have a friend in the uk<br>and i want to send him a picture in a text message<br>i can take the picture<br>send it and it gets to him whoop<br>just like that i mean that’s fucking incredible<br>i mean it literally will get there in seconds<br>we don’t even<br>we can’t even fathom how nuts that is<br>because we do it all the time<br>what’s coming next is going to make that<br>seem like riding a horse<br>that’s what’s happening that’s what i think is happening<br>that’s what i think is this whole<br>this rush for information that everybody has<br>this insane desire that human beings have for the newest<br>greatest latest technology<br>you know even<br>when you don’t need it people are always trying to<br>pump up their computers the only reason why you need<br>pumped up computer really is to play video games<br>or if you’re crunching video<br>like he needs stuff like that<br>he makes videos just<br>for raw computing power<br>but the average person<br>does is not crunching video<br>they’ve hit a wall we’ve hit a wall in computers in general<br>like they really don’t need<br>even like the fastest computers now the programs<br>the video programs aren’t even<br>yeah that’s why everybody’s into those little netbooks you know<br>those netbooks are the shit except for watching like hd videos<br>right yeah<br>and that kind of sucks and you<br>can’t load a cd into it either a dvd right<br>yeah but that technology is talking about<br>the floppy drive right before the floppy drive left<br>you know like cds and dvds are out the door even blu rays<br>have like such a small shelf life<br>and you think it’s ever gonna get to a point<br>where bandwidth will be so broad<br>and like mobile functions<br>like laptops and phones like those little mobile cards<br>it’ll be so powerful that it’ll be just like your home oh<br>it’s totally it’s gonna be all that pretty soon<br>so it’ll basically be like everything<br>will be broadband do we even know what the fuck<br>that is doing to human beings<br>you know like they talk about cell phones<br>causing radiation and you know<br>one week they say it’s bad one week they say it’s okay<br>well i think<br>do you think that it’s possible that that’s<br>altering human beings giving kids autism probably<br>it might be that it might be that<br>it might also be fucking with bees<br>there’s been speculation that it’s been fucking with bees<br>and there’s also<br>been speculation that it’s<br>some crazy virus that read that as well<br>but there’s also been speculation that wi fi<br>signals and cell phone signals that it fucks with bees ability<br>to transmit<br>we did a thing for fear factor once with bees man<br>and it was a fucking trip<br>because this guy was a beekeeper and he<br>had all these bees that he brought with him<br>so the stunt was these dudes they had to be<br>strapped to this pole we strap them to the pole<br>and then we cover them with<br>bees they have to stand there for like five minutes<br>they were getting<br>fucked up because every now and then<br>you know the bees were argue or something<br>they’d sting the dude and it was bad like they got stung up well<br>while this was all going on<br>and while<br>this guy is tending to these bees and caring for these bees<br>a local swarm of bees came in<br>so our bees and their bees were talking it out<br>and we had a back up<br>everybody had to get off the set<br>we had a closed down the set we had a closed down the stunt<br>and everybody had a move back<br>and the beekeeper saying we’ve got you know a local<br>local band of bees has moved in i forget what he calls them<br>i didn’t a hive or i don’t know<br>but that’s like that<br>whatever the local band of bees moved in<br>to sort it out with these bees<br>so our bees and their bees<br>were just as fucking swarm in the sky and<br>then we’re fighting<br>they were just talking<br>like so what’s up<br>what are you guys doing i work for fair factor<br>you know work with fair factor<br>we got some dudes we’re gonna<br>cover them in bees and shit they were like working out<br>what was going on<br>and then they resolved their differences<br>and the local bees went a separate way<br>and then the his bees stayed was it like a black cloud yes<br>that’s crazy dude it was nuts it was a big<br>fucking cloud of bees in the air<br>and the bees were communicating<br>where’s your cell phone<br>why weren’t you filming<br>it was back in the day you didn’t have an east seven<br>eighteen or whatever morola<br>we had a<br>press four times to get it ask of yours do you remember how bad<br>this little motorola was working like e eight fifteen<br>is that what it was<br>i had one of those<br>but um so<br>we they wonder if that’s fucking with bees<br>if our cell phone signals and everything are fucking with bees<br>it’s that autism thing that it might be something<br>totally like that it could be it also<br>you know a lot of speculation<br>about autism is the age of the parents and that<br>the women are having<br>babies like into their thirties and forties<br>and that increases the risk<br>lot of people talked about that that’s<br>very very possible it makes sense man you know when<br>we’re just older and smarter<br>and we look at it now and we say well<br>god you know<br>how stupid would it be to have a kid when you’re eighteen<br>when you’re eighteen<br>you’re an idiot which is absolutely true but<br>when you’re an eighteen year old idiot<br>your genetics are much stronger<br>and you<br>could have a kid and the kid probably wouldn’t be as fucked up<br>i mean the reality is<br>even though we are<br>lengthening our lifetimes with nutrition<br>and you know science<br>and we’re figuring out a way to make people live longer really<br>people aren’t supposed to live much longer than like fifty<br>you know in back in the day if you live to be fifty holy shit<br>you pulled off an amazing thing<br>you know but not not anymore<br>now people are living to be a hundred ten<br>and you got sylvesters to loan of<br>sixty two years old he’s fucking<br>yoked and shredded<br>you know things are getting very strange now that’s why<br>guys are smart they’ll just knock up eighteen year old girls<br>when they want to get you know yeah<br>eighteen year old girls would definitely give you the better<br>genetics the real question<br>though is do you<br>do you get anything other than you know like hair color<br>eye colored personality<br>do you get learned experiences<br>and is it better off to have a parent with a lot of experiences<br>are<br>those experiences transfer through dna i never thought of that<br>because they didn’t use to think it was they used to think that<br>ideas were<br>only they were native to the person who had the idea<br>but now they’re starting to think that memes can actually<br>be transferred through genetics<br>and that useless traits even like racism<br>racism can be transferred through genetics<br>and it kind of makes sense because<br>there’s a lot of things that we have<br>inside our genetics and our instincts<br>that are basically ancient learned things<br>like for instances do name a rupert sheldrake<br>group of childrek is like this<br>evolutionary biologist dude and he pointed out that children<br>that live in new york city<br>they don’t have dreams about like muggers<br>or car accidents they have nightmares about monsters<br>about scary monsters<br>and the reason<br>they have nightmares about scary monsters is because back in<br>our heads somewhere deep in our dna<br>we remember back when we were like monkeys when we were<br>these little apes<br>hanging around in trees and you’re running away from big cats<br>and that that shit is always<br>in our head because that is like the number<br>one thing that<br>was that fed off<br>of chimps and apes is big cats<br>big cats are constantly killing monkeys and chimps and apes<br>and that’s like when they find like old human beings<br>like you know<br>the you know evolutionary versions of human beings you know<br>subhuman hominoids they find<br>all their skeletons like a lot of them have like big fucking cat<br>bites big you<br>know markings so<br>that’s like some memory that we have ingrained in<br>our genetics in whoever<br>the fuck we are<br>it’s very possible that if you’re like eighteen years old<br>and you know you<br>fuck a chick and she’s eighteen year both retarded<br>you’re gonna have a dumbass kid you know i mean that might be<br>it might not just be<br>you know your hair color<br>and your eye color and how tall you’re gonna be<br>it might<br>be your actual experiences and your human potential like that<br>second yeah<br>maybe yeah yeah<br>maybe if you’re a loser like<br>if you’re a fucking drunk if you get<br>hammered and you’re fucked up and your life is in the toilet<br>and you know you bang some chick who’s<br>you know on the rebound and<br>you know our old boyfriend needs to beat her and<br>you shoot a load in her maybe a kid would be just like<br>really fucking dumb and prone to make terrible mistakes<br>you know i mean maybe he can get past it but maybe<br>his inclination like maybe<br>maybe we start off in a certain place in life not just based on<br>the economic situation that our parents are in<br>and you know on who the people we grow up with<br>and what are our jenna<br>maybe it’s<br>maybe it’s<br>our position starts out based on<br>what the parents were thinking<br>and doing when they fucked and conceived<br>you like maybe if that’s the lowest point in their life<br>you not even because of the way they raise you<br>they could take you away<br>and raise you in an orphanage somewhere totally different<br>but your potential is limited by<br>the circumstances in which you were conceived<br>do you think that’s possible<br>maybe i don’t think we have any idea<br>so i think anything’s possible you know that<br>but it’s very obvious that there’s a bunch of different<br>types of humans<br>there’s like super powerful<br>super successful<br>super smart humans<br>and there’s really<br>fucking dumb people<br>i think is the percentage of your brain being used<br>you know i think people use more brain than other people<br>and i think it’s such a small percentage but even that<br>you know yeah maybe<br>that’s the real<br>way to become a superhero<br>find out how to use a hundred percent of your brain<br>but isn’t that<br>bullshit i’ve heard that that’s bullshit that we don’t use yeah<br>i mean when they cook it up<br>it shows the yeah but that’s not what that part is for<br>you know i think<br>that all<br>you know human beings only use ten percent of their brain<br>is i think that’s a myth yeah<br>i think he’s a myth well<br>they don’t know exactly what every<br>part of the brain is for it’s like<br>they’re still like<br>it’s like you know it’s like<br>charting out the bottom of the sea<br>there’s a lot of shit that they still haven’t figured out yet<br>all right let’s see if any of you<br>motherfuckers are smarter than us<br>and have answers to all these things that we’re talking about<br>it is weird when you see like a human brain on tv<br>and you’re just like that’s somebody<br>that’s a person<br>that used to be a person<br>it’s crazy it doesn’t make any sense it’s nuts<br>all right this twitter is blowing the fuck up<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>yeah you spelled twitter wrong<br>i spelled twitter wrong on the twitter backslash jaron and<br>i did retard should i fix that no who cares<br>shit you know what i’m talking about<br>doo doo doo doo doo<br>damn a lot of questions should watch a scanner darkly yeah<br>you know what man<br>a scanner darkly is something<br>that i bought a long ass time ago i got it on dvd<br>and i just have never gotten around and watching it<br>i tried to watch<br>i stop antichrist<br>why did you lose top<br>i don’t remember<br>it just wasn’t that interesting damn you hear that shit cross<br>what the fuck i said it wasn’t interesting you recommended it<br>and he said it’s wack<br>canna reese man<br>canna reese is tough action<br>is there ever been a guy<br>that more universally panned as an actor<br>but more incredibly successful there’s no<br>i mean he like<br>he blows him off the fucking charlie slip by every time oh<br>here’s something that i needed to say<br>they actually found had a playboy article this<br>month that there was a roadhouse video game in the<br>being made a few years ago<br>but the company went bankrupt<br>a roadhouse video game<br>which is like the patrick’s ways he moved yeah<br>that’s the greatest bad movie ever<br>it’s right up there with show girls<br>if you haven’t seen roadhouse<br>i don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you<br>if you haven’t seen show girls<br>drop this chat and and<br>either download it or go to the video store and do something<br>you gotta watch show girls show girls is awesome<br>just a quick essential movie where<br>the people who are doing the movie were just<br>gacked out of their fucking minds on cocaine<br>and they made a terrible movie that makes no sense<br>and it’s so bad that it’s good<br>it’s like perfect<br>it’s just one of those movies that just perfectly crosses over<br>into parody<br>to the point where you could watch it over and over and over<br>again right<br>i’ve only seen it twice show girls is awesome<br>but show girls and roadhouse are both basically the same movie<br>they’re both movies where it’s like<br>they got people that were just full of themselves enough<br>and just<br>underestimated intelligence the viewers enough<br>and just hack enough<br>and just<br>you know they just followed the dumbest formula lines possible<br>and the difference between roadhouse and<br>show grows though<br>is that roadhouse seems to be raw stupidity on its own<br>where it show girls is<br>the most obvious cocaine movie of all time<br>because it’s just so dumb<br>like you had to be on coke to think that that was a good movie<br>like<br>if you made that movie and you weren’t on coke<br>you would watch the daylights and you’d be like<br>what the fuck are we doing<br>what are we doing what is this movie<br>but if you’re on coke you’re like yeah<br>it’s fucking awesome give me another line<br>what was your<br>what’s your bit<br>i’ll tell you how to escalate which one<br>has something to do with like<br>would you even be able to see it yet<br>because you know the human brain hasn’t seen it yet<br>oh no it’s my theory about about how we<br>believe that everything around us is everything there is<br>right and i talk about farts<br>and what i say is that<br>if someone farted and you didn’t have a nose<br>you’d have no idea<br>something was going no no<br>i’m talking about something you used to say a while ago<br>something like<br>kind of you were kind of saying like how<br>would you even be able to see it<br>because our brain hasn’t seen it yet like the tiger<br>or so oh like<br>that i didn’t mean the tiger bit was that<br>if a tiger was running at you<br>would you be able to even watch that<br>because i think your brain would start producing<br>something about the pyramid or something you used to have a<br>thing where you talked about like<br>would they even be able to see it<br>because their brains never seen it before<br>and so i don’t think so man that’s not my act<br>that’s i think you’re thinking of there’s<br>a part in the movie this secret<br>where those retards claim that<br>or was a what the bleep do we know<br>i think it was a bleep yeah yeah well<br>they were like<br>looking like they said the indians couldn’t recognize the boat<br>that’s why they didn’t see it<br>that was not my act right<br>no my act is the part about how<br>if we didn’t have a nose and you<br>smell a fart and this is for the people that are watching us<br>this is the idea is that<br>we don’t have any idea<br>if there’s more around us all the time that we can’t sense<br>and it’s very possible there is<br>and what i say is the fart theory and the fart theory is<br>if someone farted<br>and you couldn’t smell it<br>you’d have no idea that there’s something around you<br>it’s totally completely invisible<br>but if someone farts<br>you fucking smell it but if you didn’t have a nose<br>you’d be just sitting in someone’s stench<br>how do we not know<br>that there aren’t an infinite amount of things<br>that we just can’t detect<br>and that smell<br>even though we can’t detect<br>it’s like it’s for biological reasons you know<br>you smell gas<br>you know it’s dangerous for you you smell fire get away<br>there’s a reason why we have a sense of smell<br>it’s good for us but what if we didn’t<br>if we didn’t it would be an<br>invisible thing<br>and it’s just our imagination that limits<br>the possibilities of how many other invisible things there are<br>around us all the time that we can’t detect<br>there’s all sorts of animals like worms<br>you take your hand you rolled over<br>you know above a worm they have no idea<br>you’re there they have no idea<br>it’s very possible that if that exists in nature<br>that there’s also<br>some shit like that with human beings it’s very possible that we<br>are constantly<br>like the idea of dimensions<br>dimensions might be dimensions of perception we just might not<br>have the ability to perceive<br>all these other things that are around us all the time<br>i mean that could be like<br>bad energy like you go into a house i mean people<br>many people have told stories<br>they go into a house where people have been murdered<br>and they could feel it<br>they could feel it fucked up energy in the house<br>like that all might be real shit you know<br>like<br>we don’t have a name for it and we’re not good at detecting it<br>you know we call it a sense or a feeling<br>that might be real energy that you’re detecting we’re just not<br>evolved enough to the point where we can really tune into it yet<br>why is it that we like<br>our own farts but not somebody else’s fart<br>my farts are delicious<br>do you think<br>it’s just like i don’t know you think we would enjoy<br>if we made ourselves<br>you know<br>like if you forced yourself to smell my farts and enjoy it like<br>make yourself enjoy<br>you’d have to be one of those sick dudes that<br>wax off to fart porn<br>you know<br>cause there’s dudes to do that just dudes oh yeah fart baby<br>there’s dudes that like that that’s real<br>but i’ve never heard of anybody who likes their buddies fartsy<br>that’s weird though it’s amazing there should be<br>meanwhile i enjoy my own fork i love my father everybody does<br>if you’re in your car and<br>you feel a hot one<br>and you blast you when you do this you step boy<br>you smoking when i’m in the shower<br>i cut my hand around my ass and i call it a donald duck<br>and because it’s good<br>you like it makes a donald duck noise when you and when i fart<br>and it doesn’t smell i’m always disappointed yeah<br>like if i fart<br>nothing it’s worse<br>yeah but like there’s somebody else farts like on a plane<br>you’re like oh<br>you motherfucker<br>i can’t believe you did why is that that we should love it<br>i know that smells the same<br>it’s not like your fort smell different than i<br>well with our farts i think we get<br>a little reward like oh<br>you’re getting all this bad stuff out of your body<br>but with other people’s farts it’s like oh<br>you stinky fuck you know<br>it’s not the same reward<br>though is there any other smells that do that<br>i don’t like to smell my shit<br>don’t like that i tell you that i don’t like that<br>when i take a nasty dump one oh<br>get me out of that room right<br>i don’t when i go back in<br>like i would blow my nose or something like that<br>i go to get some toby oh<br>what the fuck that was my shit yeah<br>i don’t like it<br>but i do that’s funny man<br>you do like have you ever had a shit outside<br>you ever have to take like a shit in the woods<br>that’s the worst<br>because there’s no water or anything<br>it’s just steamy stinky fucking dump on the dirt yeah<br>it smells horrible<br>nobody ever like is like<br>sniffing their<br>pile of shit and getting all<br>happy about it it makes no sense hmm it doesn’t make any sense<br>it’s like what is the evolutionary reason for that<br>you know what is the reason<br>it’s probably like the cure of aid somewhere in that hmm<br>something that<br>like researchers on i’m not going to research on farts<br>what do you think okay<br>what do you think about all these dudes<br>and there’s a bunch of scientists online<br>like<br>what is that there’s just<br>one guy that’s at the head of the cause<br>peter dewsburg<br>and they’re all saying that hiv does not cause aids<br>and that hiv is a very weak virus<br>and that the only reason why hiv exists in the systems<br>of these people<br>that are have aids<br>is because their immune system<br>is so compromised that it can’t even kill off hiv well<br>i think it’s really weird that most of the people<br>it seems that that have aids are drug users and gaze<br>so they’re going to<br>have something to do at the immune system but then you get<br>fucking what’s his name<br>the basketball player that had fake aids<br>that’s the other thing is that people<br>test negative after a while like in the rich<br>people and then it goes<br>into a dormant stage yeah<br>i mean magic johnson had aids<br>and now he’s doing like mattress commercials right you know<br>right it’s like crazing why is he doing mattress commercials<br>he didn’t get<br>you know why he spent a lot of money on aids medicine yeah<br>i think i don’t know man i guess i mean<br>they probably pay him millions dollars do any commercial<br>he still got a good name how much mattresses<br>though are you gonna sell this pay that millionaire<br>how many more of these<br>basketball players all these dudes who you know are out<br>there just fucking banging chicks<br>left and right<br>they must be freaking out about this tiger woodshit<br>this tiger<br>wood shit will throw a monkey wrench into your endorsement<br>deals and like if you’re like a michael jordan type of dude<br>like that’s like where those guys make them<br>the bulk of their cash is in endorsements<br>but that’s why this is so dangerous to tiger woods<br>it’s not the tiger woods can’t go out there and still<br>kick ass and golf<br>and say fuck you<br>i don’t do whatever i want he can<br>but he can’t<br>because the endorsements is where he gets all his cash<br>well look at letterman<br>same thing it’s like<br>it’s blown up this year two thousand nine sucks<br>no it doesn’t suck it’s what i was talking about before<br>i think<br>what we’re seeing in celebrities<br>is mirrored is going to be mirrored in human beings<br>we’re seeing more access to information<br>we’re seeing less secrets i think it’s a trend i think<br>it’s a trend because i think that’s eventually<br>what the human race is going to come to<br>it’s going to come to a point time<br>where there is not going to be any secrets<br>and that’s a good thing<br>there’s going to be full information discles from you to me<br>and what it is is the convergence of all human beings that’s<br>what’s going to<br>to start to ignite the convergence<br>amongst all human beings<br>it’s going to be full access to information<br>i know everything in your head<br>you know everything in my head<br>it’s pretty weird man it’s<br>pretty fucking crazy and that’s where it’s going<br>it’s going through technology<br>and this is what<br>the internet’s about this is what<br>twitter’s about this is what this eustrophe tread is about<br>this is what all this shit is about<br>it’s about a convergence of human beings like human beings are<br>eventually merging<br>into one thing i mean that’s<br>the whole ancient line in eastern mysticism and<br>eastern religion is you know that we are all one<br>we are you know<br>we are one consciousness<br>like the bill hicks joke experiencing himself subjectively<br>you know that’s<br>the the timothy leary ideology<br>the ideology of all the all the psychedelic heads<br>all the people that you know<br>really got into like heavy duty psychedelic drugs<br>in that it’s just one thing<br>and that we can’t recognize that we’re one thing<br>because we have ego<br>we have survival and we have all these things<br>but that our technology and<br>the technology<br>forcing us to evolve that the access to information<br>that technology provides<br>eventually will cause human beings<br>all human beings to converge and literally be like one<br>consciousness<br>if i know all your thoughts<br>i know all your information<br>and we have an access to it<br>an interface<br>that’s much less crew than what we have now with typing<br>and with researching or watching documentaries<br>what if it’s like an instant access<br>a human neuro transplant something that allows all of us<br>to link up our minds together<br>that’s not that<br>outside of the realm of possibility<br>that to me seems<br>just as likely as the ability to send a picture<br>through the internet on your phone<br>that’s just<br>that’s just as fucking crazy that you can send video<br>through the air<br>and you could watch a youtube video<br>on your iphone you’re like what the<br>fuck i mean it’s just<br>coming through the air<br>and you put the headphones on and it’s in stereo like what<br>that’s going through the fucking sky<br>is just as<br>likely that human beings are eventually going to come to some<br>sort of a some sort of a technological invention something<br>that we’re going to come to something<br>that allows all human beings to interface together<br>it might be through this thing<br>it might be something you put on<br>and everybody else that has it on all links in together<br>or it might have actually become something like something<br>you put in your body<br>or it might be something<br>they broadcast through the fucking air that links people<br>together<br>i can’t<br>i just can’t wait till it gets cheaper to be able to like<br>upgrade your body parts like i want to have better<br>eyeballs i want night vision<br>i want to have fucking twitter<br>i want a new eye<br>about that woman that they made her a new bladder yeah<br>out of the new bladder<br>they took her own bladder they scraped the cells together<br>and yeah they grew it as i don’t know if the stem cells yeah<br>it’s just yeah stem cells<br>but i know<br>they grew a new bladder for her in a fucking petri dish<br>and then installed it in her body<br>that’s crazy<br>you know a bladder just kind of a bag for piss but<br>that’s gonna happen<br>with other shit too man i transplants are crazy too though<br>that’s amazing you imagine<br>jessica my friends<br>uncle died and they donated their eyes and<br>help somebody see that can now see and they got a letter<br>just to let you know<br>your uncle’s eyes were donated as so and so person<br>who can now see and they get sent him a whole letter<br>so you can imagine<br>somebody you know who’s dead now<br>but their eyeballs are still being used<br>that’s incredible<br>that’s like a nightmare that’s like a horror movie right<br>like well i heard about so<br>i was thinking i was listening to the art bell show<br>about some lady who donated her<br>or she she got a liver from somebody and an operation<br>and right immediately after the<br>operation that she<br>started having cravings for what others dude are you serious<br>yeah that’s fucked out yeah<br>cravings she never had before<br>and then she found out of the dude like really like to eat this<br>certain type of thing<br>very strange now<br>i wonder if you got a butt transplant if you like<br>that person’s farts if you like your own farts<br>still if you got somebody else’s butt<br>people may ask the weirdest questions dawkins twenty<br>look at this bill hicks the comedian<br>how are they the same guy<br>what the fuck kind of question is that<br>what does that mean<br>that doesn’t mean anything that’s not how are they the same guy<br>he’s one guy he’s<br>how are they the same guy what<br>alex jones is bill hicks oh<br>this is people believe alex jones bill hicks<br>i met bill hicks<br>i’m friends with alex jones<br>they’re not the same guy<br>isn’t that retarded that these people cannot be serious it<br>has to be a joke it’s an internet meme right<br>because<br>if you guys are being serious about<br>that you guys are fucking retarded<br>yeah that’s pretty so<br>alright let’s go some questions here<br>magic johnsons bought the cure for aids yeah<br>magic johnson great south park episode too<br>i love that<br>care for you there was no better<br>south park episode than the one where<br>the the gay dude had a horror off with<br>perry south carousel yeah shelter up his ass<br>i remember watching that going how do they get away with this<br>you don’t pass on circumstances but you can pass on<br>the psychic ability to create them alright<br>alright christine m valez<br>how do you know that<br>do you really know that are you just you say maybe<br>maybe that’s what’s happening<br>but you don’t know the psychic ability to create them<br>have you ever met anybody<br>that says that they’re a channeler<br>or says that they’re psychic that isn’t a<br>fucking retard have you ever met anyone<br>i don’t believe<br>any of it every time they do it<br>they’re like fucking scam artist to me yeah<br>i’ve never met one person that<br>says they’re a psychic<br>or says they can channel that isn’t retarded<br>they’re all retarded<br>but then it’s like<br>almost like do you have to be retarded to be able to do that<br>maybe you have to be<br>like some some other person that can<br>like you’re so<br>socially inept<br>you’re so clueless to how other people perceive you<br>that you can achieve<br>certain frequencies that other people can’t<br>is that possible<br>anything’s possible<br>cannot get alex jones on opian anthony<br>i don’t think so man i don’t think that’s a good idea<br>i saw what little jimmy<br>what little jimmy did to jesse ventura<br>i don’t think we’d like that yeah<br>alex johns is not the kind of guy you’re supposed to like<br>argue with like that<br>he’s supposed to enjoy his company<br>and ask him questions<br>and then we started talking about the new world order<br>black helicopters<br>ladies<br>and gentlemen i see them outside of my window every night<br>you tell me i’m crazy<br>but i see<br>black helicopters outside my window so what is going on<br>you don’t you don’t argue with that dude you go damn man<br>motherfucking black helicopters that’s what he’s supposed to do<br>and that’s supposed to like<br>and i think if i was in the room with jesse ventura<br>i’m certain i would have handled it different than jimmy did<br>but jimmy’s one of those dudes were<br>jim norton<br>fantastic comedian funniest guy in radio without a doubt by far<br>he’s one of those dudes that when he<br>you know when he’s in the face of someone who’s like a bully<br>he doesn’t like that shit he doesn’t stand up to that shit well<br>and he feels like that jesse like<br>has this slow burn in his eyes and i’m a navy shield<br>and all that shit<br>and that you’re supposed to listen to him because of that<br>and jim norman just ain’t buying that<br>and that’s why jimmy just shut him down<br>and clowned him<br>that’s just what he does he’s just he’s not good at people<br>being bullies<br>i respect that<br>people that meditate have large frontal lobe cortexes study show<br>says pete shreds<br>i wonder that’s very possible right<br>it’s very possible<br>that<br>it changes the way your brain works i mean if you lift weights<br>you know it changes the way your muscles look if you if you<br>exercise your mind in certain ways it<br>doesn’t don’t you think it would make that happen yeah<br>brian is gonna smoke marijuana live<br>right here on u stream thank god it’s all legal supposedly<br>that’s the only thing obama’s done<br>that he said he would do it’s not going after weed<br>readiculous all right what<br>else what else party people let’s go to the rogan board<br>and read some of the questions that you find people have<br>what is my opinion on free will<br>blog talks about how we’re all living through<br>different circumstances<br>which is very true<br>but it seems denote the power of free will which kind of sucks<br>i don’t know you know<br>i go i start thinking about free will<br>i think about<br>free will in a couple of different ways i think it’s very<br>possible that you know<br>you are shaping your own destiny and that you know you can<br>you know<br>choose your path and you can you know go through this life<br>and you know and make something to yourself<br>and<br>you know the fact that you did it by yourself and you have to<br>free will it’s all good i think that’s very possible<br>but i think it’s all poss it’s also possible that life itself is<br>a gigantic mathematical algorithm<br>that all life itself is like a gigantic mathematical equation<br>and that<br>it just doesn’t seem like an equation because we’re a part of it<br>but like that everything<br>your personality<br>your biology your circumstances<br>your experiences<br>they’re all<br>set up in line to put you in a very specific position<br>to move forward in a very specific way to interface<br>with all the other very specific things that are around you<br>all the other very specific people<br>very specific events and that the idea is that<br>what the idea of free will<br>is sort of a misnomer like you have<br>instincts and you have experiences that<br>guide you into a certain way<br>like say if you<br>you know you drank poison<br>you almost died and it was terrible<br>and you didn’t know it’s poison well<br>you’ll be much more careful next time<br>and you won’t drink poison the idea that that<br>circumstance that you have experienced has led you<br>in a very specific way<br>and that your experiences literally are set up<br>as a part of a mathematical equation<br>and that it’s all to lead this entire human race<br>which is really just one organism<br>one gigantic superorganism<br>to lead this entire human race into a very specific place<br>for a very specific purpose<br>that’s possible you know i don’t like to think it you know<br>when your ego has<br>any control whatsoever over your mind<br>your ego wants you to think that no<br>you know i am in control my whole my life i have done<br>what i have done<br>and i am proud of all that i have done because<br>it’s my own accomplishments<br>but really it might be<br>you’re following a program<br>it really might be<br>we’re all a part of this gigantic program that’s<br>you know and that all this you know<br>ego justification ego gratification<br>sex and love and fun and happiness<br>and all these things are really just<br>like numbers and<br>equations and like<br>the powerful number that you<br>get from love forces you<br>to you know to be in love and have children<br>and to create more people<br>and to be good to those people and<br>those people create more good people<br>and that these these rewards<br>are all in fact set up as a part of an equation<br>to move the human race into one specific place<br>that everyone is working together<br>all over the world and we just don’t realize it where bees<br>yeah we’re bees i<br>mean we don’t know how bees communicate we don’t know<br>what sort of a culture bees have<br>but we know that they don’t have books<br>they can’t study their past they can’t study their history<br>i mean how conscious how aware are they<br>are they just going through the motions because<br>that’s how they’re programmed and<br>if that’s the case if that’s the case with<br>wolves and bears and every other animal that<br>sort of goes through these<br>natural motions to achieve a specific result<br>maybe that’s what we’re doing<br>maybe we’re just doing it<br>and it’s way more complicated because what we’re doing<br>is we’re actually<br>changing our environment we’re changing the world<br>we’re creating computers and creating technology<br>and we’re involved we’re the only<br>animal on the planet that’s involved<br>in this symbiotic relationship with another<br>life form and that other life form is technology<br>i mean if you<br>don’t classify life as something that has a heartbeat<br>something that bleeds<br>but if you classify life<br>as something that evolves and changes and grows<br>and something that is like inexorably<br>linked to human beings technology is just like a virus<br>technology is just like something<br>some sort of a bacteria that’s in your system<br>that you can’t get out of<br>you know like you have to<br>you have a lot of healthy bacteria in your body all the time<br>and that’s like<br>you have a symbiotic relationship with this healthy bacteria<br>and it keeps you alive<br>and it actually fights off other bacteria<br>i mean that’s what probiotics are<br>that’s what acidophilus says you’re taking in a live culture<br>that will be your warriors and they will fight off bad bacteria<br>well it’s very possible that that’s what<br>technology is the technology is<br>a life force that we are interfaced with<br>and we have a symbiotic relationship with this other thing<br>and we needed to keep us alive<br>we needed to keep the power on<br>you know to keep<br>to keep us warm in cold climates to<br>you know to make sure your car gets you to work<br>you know<br>to make sure that the airbag goes off to save your life<br>and all this shit<br>is designed to help us<br>but in turn we keep it going<br>we look at old<br>cars on the side of the road that are broken down and dead<br>and those things are just like dead bodies you know<br>cars that are old that stay alive that’s just like wow that’s<br>fucking cool that’s just like seeing an old man at the gym<br>with big muscles like holy shit<br>you know<br>i mean literally like technology and things that we create<br>we<br>are<br>helping those things evolve we are helping those things evolve<br>with our materialism<br>with our obsession with technology<br>we are<br>trying to always constantly get the newer better cooler shit<br>and in doing that and in supplying that we are forcing people<br>to work in that industry and continue to evolve technology<br>i mean it’s very possible that it’s all one fucking big thing<br>so<br>that’s my opinion on that<br>what i get for christmas your mother’s pussy oh<br>what’s my opinion oh this is too tripping<br>some people just get way too dmt on me<br>extreme extreme hippies that value that are<br>weird to me yeah<br>this is dude’s question this is enthioshaman<br>what is your opinion of the non ordinary reality access by dmt<br>and other<br>and theo substances and theo gins are<br>i think<br>the literal translation is something that connects you to god<br>but it’s psychedelic drugs do you feel there is much to learn<br>from this version of reality<br>how can it be applied to ordinary reality<br>that’s the real problem with any psychedelic drugs<br>whether you’re doing<br>salvio or doing dmt or smoking weed<br>it’s like<br>are you bringing any of that back is it enhancing your life<br>do you think anything enhances you la<br>i don’t know that question to me<br>seems like he wrote it in the garage with his car running<br>我第一次买的<br>第一次 what’s my take on charlie sheen<br>charlie sheen is a dude who’s friends with alex jones<br>like me but he’s not laughing<br>he is a nine eleven conspiracy buff he’s an actor he knows<br>that’s a problem<br>that you know he might have just know he’s an actor<br>actors are tough action man<br>i mean i know a couple actors that are pretty cool<br>but<br>not that many most of them are really annoying<br>somebody said it best that actors like comedians<br>but with no punch lines<br>they always want to talk and go<br>shit they’re not giving you anything back<br>at least like with joey diaz<br>is talking like you’re gonna be laughing<br>and you’re gonna enjoy it you want him to talk<br>but actors just talk<br>you know<br>actors always have the answers to like<br>if you’re talking to actors very rarely<br>does an actor want to admit that they don’t know why<br>something is this or something is that why<br>you know they always have an opinions like really<br>poorly thought out opinions whether it’s on politics or<br>war anything<br>have you recently unfollowed somebody on twitter because they<br>just twitted too much<br>i just unfollowed them yeah no<br>i hardly ever unfollow someone<br>the only time i<br>block people if they just looking to have arguments with me<br>i’m sort of<br>boring but<br>i follow the dumbest motherfuckers i follow so many dumb people<br>i don’t even want to tell you what they’re doing<br>i don’t want to tell you who they are because some of them<br>some of them are just fantastic<br>they’re fantastic<br>they’re<br>terrible tweets i just unfold kevin smith the other day because<br>he literally spent two hours replying to every single person<br>that has rhodeum<br>in like the last two months<br>energy did it because it blocks up here<br>it was all him and had no one else i’m like oh<br>next page are you serious yeah<br>but don’t you like him though i do like him but that’s<br>bullshit the dude needs to learn out of fucking he’s twitter<br>well how are you supposed to do it<br>if you don’t reply<br>direct messages<br>but to all those people if you’re gonna if you’re gonna<br>release all our time we don’t care what this answer<br>this question is that if you do yeah but the dev messages<br>the problem<br>with the direct messages is that you can’t everybody else can’t<br>see it and<br>one of the cool things about kevin smith is it like well<br>i think maybe we’re following kevin smith and you get to see<br>everybody saw<br>kevin smith responded to you well dude this video<br>type shit then and reply it all you know like a go okay<br>here’s our next person<br>from twitter what change is a little dude<br>because it just ruins everything else i hate it<br>i met kevin smith and he’s cool as fuck so i will cool as up<br>i will never unfollow him<br>he could put pages of shit on my twitter<br>and i will i will keep it going dude i love the dude roll<br>i love the dude but that’s just uncalled for it<br>what do i think of ben stein<br>calling ron paul anti semitic i don’t think about it at all<br>that’s hilarious those two old queens<br>i would love to see<br>ben stein and ron paul suck at each other’s cos yeah<br>i would pay a thousand dollars for that video have you seen<br>bruno yet no<br>i have that on video too it’s nothing i haven’t<br>watched it and it’s it’s it’s<br>that whole part<br>with ron pon and ever since i’ve seen it i always<br>look at him and he looks like an old queen to me now<br>ever since then ron pa yeah<br>just how i handle that he hated like<br>he can’t i don’t know<br>well he’s super religious<br>so that’s possibly gang right<br>if you’re really intelligent and yet super religious<br>i always gotta go alright<br>what’s going on what are you doing<br>blog guys what are you doing it’s weird yeah<br>something wrong is either money or gay<br>you’re really intelligent and you’re really buying into<br>and this is not saying you know that there’s no god<br>it’s not saying that there’s no<br>this is not something else i’m the first one to say<br>that i don’t know i have no idea<br>but i’m also the first one to say that you don’t know either<br>and anybody<br>that pays any attention to religion or follows religion at all<br>and it looks at the history of religion knows that it’s a<br>it’s a disjointed<br>mess and nobody even<br>knows the origins of all this stuff and nobody knows<br>how much people<br>altered the words and<br>what we do know about it is that<br>even the bible itself the oldest version of the bible<br>they didn’t even use the dead sea scrolls<br>that’s the oldest version of the bible by far they don’t even<br>they don’t even use that when you think that’s like the best one<br>wouldn’t it that’s like the purest version of it<br>now we’re still busy using the new testament<br>the new testament was created by constantine<br>and a bunch of bishops<br>they piled it together in the old testament well<br>the old testament the real<br>real version of it was written in ancient hebrew<br>and to this day in two thousand nine<br>they only know three out of four words in ancient hebrew that’s<br>twenty five fucking percent of the words they don’t know<br>what the fuck it means<br>and on top of that letters also<br>doubled there’s numbers back then because there was no numbers<br>so the letter a was also like the number one<br>like if you did it that way<br>so there was like numerical value to words<br>that was completely lost<br>when they translated ancient hebrew to latin and then to greek<br>so like the word love<br>and the word god they have the same numerical value<br>so we don’t even really know what the fuck they were saying<br>so no<br>i’m not saying that there’s no god that there’s not something<br>else but what i’m saying is to follow<br>current religion as it’s you know<br>practiced and preached to that it’s ridiculous it’s ridiculous<br>so if ron paul’s really into that<br>come on man<br>big old queen<br>what is he doing<br>what’s ron paul big old queen look<br>if he just came out and said he’s a big old queen<br>i would still vote for him man i think he’s a bad motherfucker<br>i would like to see if somebody really tried to get in there<br>and shake up the system<br>and change the way<br>you know<br>the world is run and keep us out of other countries and<br>demolish the irs and get rid of the cia and<br>that’d be fascinating<br>fascinating<br>to see if someone can actually do that and not get killed<br>i don’t think they could<br>you’re a kindle<br>yeah i got a kindle<br>well<br>just wonder i just got one of the sony readers for christmas<br>it’s cool because google buy like all these books and so<br>i don’t know<br>if you can do this with the kindor or not but with the sony one<br>you can just go to google<br>and download all these free books onto it<br>really and they have your<br>issue of kung fu magazine or whatever karate magazine oh<br>that i was in yeah they have that hunger<br>and so that’s the sony reader you can go and get that<br>so you get any book basically for free well<br>not any book but any other ones on google has like ton of books<br>but they’re all like old school out of print books<br>thing has to be out man<br>i got the kindle and i couldn’t get any<br>hunterist thompson books<br>really like one book that he wrote that was for sale<br>but they didn’t have the great<br>shark hunt they didn’t have good at google<br>com backslash books<br>and see if they have it there and he was downloaded<br>i don’t know if it works on kindle though probably<br>the kindle reads pdf files it does but<br>when it reads pdf files doesn’t let you enlarge the text<br>which is why oh you can do that in the sony<br>shut about the wrong one<br>and then i don’t care<br>it still better probably<br>and our question earlier when we were talking about can poker<br>can these bots on poker sites<br>poker j<br>who’s john carlos avarado<br>who’s on the rogan board says<br>poker sites catch bots of the program<br>that can see if you click the same pixel<br>every time you make a move<br>something that’s impossible to do by a human<br>that’s why you have the program go over a couple pixels<br>yeah every time<br>ryan would change the program she figured it out<br>already the thing sucks<br>how was the shit i just thought it was excellent<br>did i really forget everything<br>i learned during the tyke window days no<br>i still remember some tyke window stuff<br>some stuff tyke window is effective<br>like you see kungley uses a lot of tyke window<br>he uses a lot of turn sidekicks and front leg sidekicks and<br>front leg roundhouse kicks where he doesn’t switch to the legs<br>that’s there’s a lot of power in that stuff<br>it’s just it’s not complete<br>in the tiger window<br>needs other things and needs moi tie and wrestling<br>and you do it soon all that stuff<br>but it helps there’s some stuff in it that’s it’s different<br>you know the style of<br>like karate<br>that machini uses like they’re leaping in and leaping out<br>nobody knew that that would work before no<br>because no one was ever good at it<br>that was good at other stuff as well<br>and i think that’s like the sort of the same<br>thing with connelly entic window<br>all right these questions all suck get back to twitter<br>suck cock on my website<br>guys are a bunch of gay ass<br>motherfuckers<br>stupid ass questions<br>not the same questions with the same people<br>circumcised here’s a good question<br>would you get your kid circumcised in this day and age<br>because most guys in america or cut no<br>i am not gonna if i have a boy this new baby<br>we don’t know what it is yet<br>we’ll find out soon<br>and if it’s a boy<br>i’m gonna<br>let him have a

turtleneck<br>have you ever seen porn just felt bad for the poor guy because<br>i’m fucking creep dick yeah<br>we talked to girls ad circumcision<br>have you talked to girls about this<br>i don’t give

different yeah yeah<br>any girl that would care is a cunt<br>it’s good it’ll keep cunts away from my boy<br>some picky cunt it doesn’t like a uncircumcised dick<br>what’s your white wide<br>you just think it’s just mean<br>ridiculous it’s a totally unnecessary end<br>it feels better supposedly you need<br>i don’t need help coming faster<br>it’s not a health coming faster<br>it actually feels better it’s more sensitive<br>it’s not whether or not you come for us you actually<br>it’s more enjoyment<br>silly man<br>i’m not getting my fucking kids ridiculous<br>this is ridiculous i hate<br>i’m so weird i’m so glad<br>i’m just like<br>that’s something i think every day i’m like thank you dad for oh<br>my god you know there’s websites out there where dudes try to<br>regrow their skin it’s a long<br>term process to re circumcise their dick they stretch it out<br>they have like little things<br>like an attachment it’s clip onto the tip of your dick<br>it gets more they get more infections in<br>like dirt inside there<br>and it’s like if you haven’t clean your dick<br>that’s my answer to that clean your fucking dick look<br>how hard is it to wash your dick i hate<br>dirty dick people should not have<br>no circumcises nerk circumcisions but<br>if you’re a cleanly person like<br>you should be like my boy will be<br>he will have an uncircumcised dick god damn it if you ever<br>i think we already talked about that what<br>have you ever ate out a girl that had really long pussy looks<br>yeah i like that<br>there’s one where i get stretched probably that far<br>it was like chewing gum<br>when you was in your mouth<br>do do do do do<br>see this is too old these questions are like old<br>this is like an hour ago oh<br>no that’s the farm hate and funny his twitter sure is his<br>twitter’s the bomb diggity<br>what is it the mark hayden<br>i think he changed it to the dub mark gaiden<br>i’m starting to think it’s not real<br>what do you mean who changed the name of it i don’t know<br>no did someone change the name of it<br>whoever’s doing it then why would they do<br>that man we got a thing going on<br>motherfuckers are you doing<br>do you think on our lifetime<br>microchips is some like they do with dogs where it’s scan<br>and some access yeah<br>i think that’s gonna happen<br>yeah i think it’s very possible<br>there’s gonna be some sort of a microchip thing<br>where human beings are gonna be scanned into a database<br>the real problem is there’s so many fucking people<br>there’s so many goddamn people how do you do<br>how do you keep track of it<br>who’s gonna watch it like people used to say oh<br>man what if your phones are bugged<br>who’s bugging these phones and workers<br>government workers how many<br>people are they watching<br>is there one person for every person out there<br>they just<br>circling on you because they know you sell pot like come on man<br>how many fucking people are out there<br>that could actually<br>be monitoring people’s phones well<br>now they have the technology<br>where they can just sit there and record<br>every single phone call<br>and it transcribes it like dragon speak<br>but time’s fifty technology<br>and it pretty much looks for keywords like money drug you know<br>yeah that’s that makes sense i’ve heard that before<br>there’s things like<br>video programs like<br>was it called predator something like that they had one yeah<br>that was would go through the internet<br>and let’s search for like al qaeda<br>search for terrorists search for certain specific keywords<br>peak oil versus science<br>you know what man<br>i think they’re gonna figure out some other shit besides oil<br>i think it makes sense i think you know<br>there’s a lot of stuff<br>they could do with agriculture<br>there’s a lot of stuff<br>they could do with hydrogen there’s a lot of stuff<br>it’s just we could have come up with something else it’s just<br>we got bamboozled into going the way the oil<br>because it was easy and cheap<br>and it was already in place<br>and we stayed with oil but<br>i don’t think society’s gonna crumble because we run out of oil<br>i think we’ll come out with something<br>just as good<br>you hear those new mini coopers in the cold the electric ones<br>in cold weather<br>it only gets half the power<br>how big is that<br>that’s ridiculous yeah<br>because they’re only good for like a hundred miles<br>as it is right<br>so in cold weather goes for fifty miles fifty miles<br>that makes sense<br>because your battery is<br>more dead in cold weather yep oh<br>a piece of shit yeah but imagine buying that car<br>that’s an expensive car imagine you know what top<br>gear did you know that show top gear in the bbc awesome show<br>they took one of those priuses an electric car<br>and they drove it around a track with a<br>priest is a hybrid right<br>they drove it around a track with an m three<br>and all the m three had to do was keep up with the prius<br>that’s all it had to do<br>the prius go it went full blaster on the track<br>and the m three obviously much<br>much faster car all i had to do is keep up<br>the prius got thirteen miles to the gallon<br>and the m three got nineteen<br>so when the prius drives hard<br>it’s just as much of a piece of shit<br>as you know any other car it’s like it’s<br>it’s nonsense it’s like it’s<br>it’s fake being green<br>and it apparently it’s much more toxic to the environment<br>to create a prius than it is to create well<br>i thought i thought how it worked as priuses<br>only<br>are electric under twenty five miles<br>an hour or something like that<br>yeah for stop and go traffic it’s running off battery over that<br>just a normal car<br>that makes sense yeah<br>and over that as a normal car it’s terrible yeah<br>it’s just a small sheet terrible goddamn piece of shit<br>that was bb jones with the circumcision question<br>it’s so weird he<br>asks i was just thinking that the other is a good question<br>man that’s a good<br>question that’s a weird thing with people<br>i did you really worry about what your kids dick looks like<br>did it start well<br>i just think every day<br>how thankful i am<br>you’re so silly<br>if i had you a little dick<br>i would climb myself to sleep over there<br>did you see somebody posted this on the board today<br>about indian men<br>and that there’s like some<br>what is it one<br>sixty percent<br>of indian men i don’t know if this is a true statistic<br>so many i’ve been rocked<br>posted it so<br>take it with a grain of salt<br>sixty percent of indian men cannot use a standard condom<br>one in five condoms fall off during intercourse<br>so this is from the bbc<br>is it true i don’t know we’re gonna go to it<br>damn the bbc we need to go to india due to fuck some women<br>wow it really is wow<br>it’s true serve you more than a thousand men in india<br>has concluded that condoms made<br>according to international sizes are too large<br>for the majority of indian men<br>that’s crazy that’s sad<br>as a magnum user i feel for you bitch<br>wow scientists even check their sample<br>check to see if their sample was representative of india<br>as a whole in terms of class<br>religion and urban and rural dwellers<br>so even like the peasants you know even<br>the slaves in india have little dicks<br>so sad at least the peasants in the lower<br>class in america<br>are generally thought to have the biggest dicks<br>right slaves<br>back in the day when they had slaves<br>those cats almost had monster horse dicks yeah<br>how many white women do you think fox slaves back<br>then oh the horse snuck in tons of do you think they did yeah<br>yeah when their husband stopped fucking them right yep<br>snuck in and just got some<br>alabama black snake<br>how many white women do you think had babies with slaves back<br>then think that happened there was a lot of dead babies<br>really i bet<br>well there was a lot of white guys<br>who would fuck their black slaves that was very common<br>and have babies with their black slaves<br>what a<br>fuck that must have been how weird must have been to the guy<br>who was the father<br>would fuck the slave<br>have a baby with a slave<br>the slave would have his<br>baby and he would see this half white baby<br>and he would just<br>leave the half white baby with the slaves<br>and let them take care of it<br>like you wouldn’t even bring it in as his kid<br>just because of a race thing<br>that must be that must have been fucking enough<br>talk about like haunting your conscience<br>woo how weird is witch trials<br>you know<br>the old school witch trials or they were like way witches or<br>it still goes on today you know in africa<br>in africa they still have a huge problem with people<br>accusing people<br>of being bewitch there’s a video where they caught them on fire<br>and they’re just sitting there on five yeah<br>they’re beating with sticks and kicking them this is real recent<br>there was a<br>here i’ll put it on twitter i wrote a blog article about it<br>that’s one of the worst videos that<br>in the hong kong girl snorting herself to death yeah<br>there’s that video that you can see this hong kong girl<br>she snorts this gigantic line of ketamine<br>ketamine is a fucking cat<br>tranquilizer and a lot of crazy kids are doing this<br>when she snorted this gigantic line for a video<br>and then wand up dying<br>and the video is available online along with the store<br>trying to find the<br>i want to put that article online that i<br>that i wrote about i think<br>it was called humanity gun haywire i think that was the<br>that was the name of the article but it was all about how<br>nutty it is that there’s this like real problem<br>they have right now<br>i don’t know what that was from there’s no search option<br>my blog archives are gay<br>mm hmm look at that there’s no search option<br>it’s weird i have a search option<br>this is terrible<br>what’s to look for<br>tell you dude<br>look at that my fucking website is<br>this is way better yeah<br>google is way better for searching than<br>my own website fucking website<br>my website is being a design right now people<br>you’ve been saying it for eight years yeah<br>it’s been been lit designed for eight years<br>that’s all sure god damn it<br>all right let me find out the<br>twitter this bitch<br>oh<br>rising<br>停车<br>all right i put it<br>i just put it up on twitter<br>if you board and you want to read the thing about witchcraft<br>watch the video if it’s still there<br>it’s really creepy<br>you know a funny thing about witchcraft in america<br>like everybody knows about the sale in witch trials<br>well what i read<br>the biggest connection<br>they have to what happened there<br>and then while everybody thought they were being possessed<br>and there’s which craft going on<br>was that there was a late frost and that the wheat got frozen<br>and when it thought out apparently<br>when that happens<br>when<br>there’s a late frost and wheat freezes and the thoughts out<br>it grows a certain fungus on it<br>and this certain fungus is called urgot<br>and urgot has it’s a really similar<br>or identical rather chemically to lsd<br>so when they would take this<br>bread that they would make from this wheat that had grown<br>this fungus on it<br>these people would fucking trip their balls off<br>they would have these crazy<br>horrifying bad acid trips<br>so they literally thought they were under a spell<br>which totally makes sense<br>and they just started burning bitches<br>and women always want to say that it’s oh<br>men were<br>back then men were<br>the spell that a woman would be cast upon her<br>upon him with her beauty was just too perplexing<br>and the men couldn’t deal with the<br>fact the women had all those powers they killed him eh come on<br>guys have been raping chicks forever<br>you tell me they gotta stop back then<br>this is not that much<br>this is not that perplexing<br>guys want to shoot a load they shoot a load you know<br>guys want to shoot a load they jerk off<br>they don’t want to shoot a load anymore you know<br>they’re not gonna<br>start burning people because they want to fuck them<br>i don’t believe that<br>i think it’s a much more likely<br>scenario that this<br>fungus grew on this wheat because they had already<br>taken soil samples and so they had known<br>from their you know whatever<br>climatological studies that they used to<br>figure out how cold it was during a specific time<br>there was a late<br>frost there were some evidence that there was a late frost<br>and then this<br>urgotte was also found somehow or another<br>during this time period<br>i think it’s just speculation<br>but it’s much more educated speculation than the idea<br>that the men were under the<br>spell of these women they decided to kill them<br>that doesn’t make any sense<br>i think they probably<br>did the acid from the wheat and then killed the cunts<br>that’s probably what it was<br>you know that’s why<br>i was a witch trial<br>those probably the cuntiest women in the town<br>they probably just let’s cook these major bitches yeah<br>like these chicks are bad energy<br>like you’d be around i’m like fucking bitches give me bad vibes<br>you know because you’re all acid and out<br>and they probably just started lighting them on fire<br>i was fucking<br>let’s kill this bitch<br>why are we having her around<br>yeah imagine if that’s really what the witch trials were around<br>maybe like afterwards people were so nice<br>they killed all the cunts off<br>could you imagine that<br>is that possible ladies and gentlemen<br>so that makes some who the fuck is calling me<br>during my goddamn podcast<br>tape flexer now i’m on fucking u stream bitch<br>how dare you<br>all right let’s go back to questions so gentlemen<br>have i ever seen the northern lights in iceland no<br>i’ve never seen them in perfect it was so awesome<br>i’ve seen some shit online though it looks incredible<br>like the sky becomes like a desktop screen saver<br>i’ve been seeing way<br>more falling stars lately<br>like it’s almost<br>getting to the point where it’s kind of ridiculous yeah<br>it’s<br>maybe you’re coming once a week maybe i see it at least one<br>could you imagine we know for<br>it doesn’t seem like it’s real like you said and talk about<br>asteroid impacts oh<br>the asteroid that killed the dinosaur is sixty five<br>million years ago<br>or the one that killed<br>you know everything before<br>that the mass extension before<br>that two hundred fifty million years ago<br>or the one that ended the ice age<br>ten thousand five hundred years ago there’s all a speculation<br>about asteroids<br>but the real reality is<br>there are<br>gigantic hundreds of thousands of gigantic rocks in space<br>that can fuck us up<br>and<br>every now and then one comes crashing down it’s happened many<br>many many<br>many many times<br>over the history of the life<br>of the earth it’s happened so many times<br>and it could easily happen today<br>it could easily happen tomorrow<br>it could easily one that comes from behind the sun<br>and we can’t see it until it’s too late<br>and the<br>boom<br>and it just fucks the whole world up that’s so possible<br>we don’t like to think it’s possible<br>because it’s never happened<br>but i always like to<br>actually i always say it’s like an ant hill<br>that human life is like an ant hill<br>like if you<br>are an ant and you’re living in an ant hill you were probably<br>born in that ant hill<br>and that ant hill is all you’ve ever known i mean aunt<br>how long did ants live like a week<br>a couple weeks<br>something like that<br>so say like this ant hill’s been around for six months<br>that’s been through the generations after generations long dead<br>have made this ant hill<br>and then you know your toilet away and your little ant<br>hill and one day some kid is walking through the field<br>and he sees that ant hill and just boom boom<br>just starts to stomp on it for no fucking reason<br>and then your aunt hills crushed out of nowhere<br>you never thought it was gonna happen<br>it’s always been fine<br>everything’s always been cool with the aunt hill<br>if you had to<br>take a gas and you had to make a gamble<br>you would say yeah yeah<br>this aunt hill’s always gonna be here it’s always been here<br>always will be here bam some kid just stomps the fuck out of it<br>that can happen to people<br>that can happen to earth katrina katrina how about detroit<br>tap him like that slow<br>slowly somebody has a magnifying glass on that detroit<br>i watched anthony bourdain how to show<br>about michigan the other night and he was there<br>they were driving through detroit oh<br>that’s horrible<br>terrible you ever want some anthony borden show<br>it’s good show makes you hungry<br>he goes oh it’s your food show yeah<br>eats all there’s no reservations right fucking shows<br>makes me so hungry<br>nasa says<br>there’s an asteroid with the possibility of hitting earth<br>in twenty twenty nine yeah<br>there’s a bunch of them out there that they don’t know about<br>they come their problem is the skies to goddamn big<br>i mean it’s covering everywhere<br>shit’s coming from the north pole and the south pole<br>and you never know where something’s coming<br>from i mean it could be coming from anywhere<br>you never know<br>there could be something head in our way<br>they just we haven’t picked up on<br>could be behind something<br>we don’t see it<br>gravity distorts<br>our view of things as well like if you look at the sun<br>you can literally<br>you know you look at some of the telescope<br>you can see things behind the sun<br>because of the distortion and the gravity<br>of the sun because it’s so massive<br>i don’t understand how that works<br>but that apparently is how it works and so<br>there’s occasionally things that could be hiding behind<br>something that’s coming straight at us<br>and we don’t even fucking see it until it’s too late<br>you know there’s just not enough human beings out there<br>monitoring the sky to really accurately predict<br>you know well<br>we’re we have a hundred percent clear skies<br>nothing’s gonna hit us for the next two hundred years<br>they don’t know that<br>they can’t say that<br>there’s always something<br>that comes real close that just barely misses us<br>and they go whoa holy shit that was three miles long<br>and they missed us by<br>two hundred thousand miles that’s not much you know<br>okay let’s go to some questions you dirty bitches<br>nabiro in two thousand twelve says the anti chris<br>mmm so some people think<br>did you ever see the two thousand twelve movie yes<br>horrendously bad really bad not even worth<br>even the special effects sucked oh really<br>they’re i mean it was awesome things were happening<br>but it didn’t look real<br>like the cars there is a limo and it’s jumping things<br>and landing fine and driving off and they<br>looked all computer generated and silly<br>you know it’s like<br>every five seconds the fucking you know<br>the car was almost going off the cliff<br>but barely made it you know<br>it’s like come on stop<br>stop with your nonsense<br>this guy here<br>an easy dog down below seven says<br>yeah i believe in god how did everything originate<br>but how did god start<br>hmm oh that’s an easy question<br>how do you<br>answer it<br>god<br>what do you do<br>the real problem is believing in anything<br>you know that’s that’s the real problem<br>real problem is believing in anything it’s not<br>believing in god<br>or believing in jail the real problem is believing in anything<br>you don’t know we don’t know<br>god created a really good video game and we’re all in it<br>that’s possible<br>that this is like god’s version of the sims right<br>and this is on somebody’s phone but wait<br>you know we’re not even like a good video<br>game we’re just like a fucking cell phone video<br>show that people<br>play when they kill times waiting in line to target right<br>right we’re breaking breaker where it’s called<br>the real problem<br>with believing in god is that believing in god<br>just makes people feel better<br>you know it’s not<br>saying that god doesn’t exist<br>it’s very possible that god exists<br>but you don’t have that information<br>no one does you can decide<br>that you have that information because it empowers you<br>you can decide that there’s a god because<br>it makes you feel more comfortable or it makes you feel more<br>you know that there’s a future to this world<br>and after you die there’s something waiting for you<br>and that gives you confidence<br>and that gives you that it can empower you<br>that works for a lot of people<br>i know a lot of fighters who are very religious and<br>that belief and god that actually empowers them and it<br>can work that way but it really is just<br>a tool it’s just a psychological tool that they’re using<br>to empower them it doesn’t necessarily help them<br>you know what helps them is the state of mind<br>that they put themselves in by believing in god<br>you know<br>it’s a really kind of a funny thing it’s a catch twenty two<br>believing in god can empower you<br>the ideas of christianity are very empowering ideas<br>the idea is that<br>you know that you know love your man as if he is you<br>and you know look<br>do unto others as if you would have them<br>do unto yourself<br>and you know turn the other cheek and don’t be violent and<br>be helping and be loving and<br>and be humble and worship god<br>the idea of god what god<br>is god is life<br>and energy and the whole universe<br>and that you treat the whole process as it’s one gigantic<br>fantastic thing<br>and that in<br>going to a religious service and in practicing<br>you know any sort of a religion and<br>like sticking to a certain ethic<br>the what you’re doing is committing to positive energy<br>and if you commit to that positive energy then those<br>positive thoughts in this positive way of thinking<br>that’s empowering<br>that really will help you and if you really do believe<br>that you have a destiny and that god has<br>carved out this destiny for you<br>that’s an empowering thing that should<br>that shit will absolutely<br>make you better things you say that’s evidence of god<br>that’s evidence of jesus well maybe<br>but more<br>likely it’s evidence that you’ve put yourself in the exact<br>proper state of mind to achieve things<br>by thinking positive and having positive energy and being<br>a loving christian by doing all those things<br>you’ve put the good energy out there<br>and you’ve given yourself confidence<br>because you’re doing the right thing<br>and you’ve given yourself<br>a strong belief in yourself<br>because you’re following the right path<br>and in doing that that’s very empowering<br>that’s how god is real that’s how religion is real<br>but<br>what it really all is at the heart of it is you tuning in to<br>the correct frequency of the universe<br>with the least amount of resistance<br>the least amount of resistance from you<br>the least amount of negative thinking the least amount of front<br>he like when i was a kid<br>i’d get an arguments all the time with everybody about anything<br>and really<br>i was just a knucklehead i was just a dumb fuck<br>but i didn’t realize that by doing that<br>by creating all this drama in my life<br>like i i<br>was just distracting the shit out of me<br>and it was keeping me from doing things that i wanted to do<br>it was keeping me from being happy and comfortable<br>and friendly and<br>keep me from<br>like i was constantly in a state of causing trouble and<br>causing drama and creating all these obstacles in my own life<br>and i didn’t realize it at the time<br>and i was thought of people that were religious<br>i was thought well<br>there’s got to be a lot of power in that because<br>like i was afraid of a dude who was<br>religious who was on one of the us<br>taikundo teams back when i was fighting there’s his dude<br>i think his name was bobby clayton<br>and i think that’s his name don’t<br>but he wasn’t the best guy<br>but he was crazy religious<br>and that used to scare the shit out of me<br>this dude used to read the bible every day<br>and this dude was like super super<br>super religious and he really believed in himself<br>and i was you know not very religious and even though i was<br>doing really well in these tournaments and i was<br>beating a lot of really good guys there was something<br>about this dude and his religion that scared me<br>like on paper<br>he shouldn’t have been the scariest guy to me but he was<br>for whatever reason because<br>this dude was really religious so for you know<br>that belief that he had in himself that<br>the belief in his faith and his<br>that all that shit was<br>empowering to him<br>and i recognized that it was empowering to him<br>he was really legit about it<br>and that he was his super religious behavior he was never<br>he never swore he didn’t drink he was friendly to everyone<br>he was like really<br>really really dedicated and that was<br>that may be nervous<br>i think religion is empowering brian has been a huge<br>advocate of scientology ever since he moved to hollywood<br>i mean tell us about your experiences with scientology there<br>they’re sluts they’re easy to yeah<br>they’re real easy to sleep with<br>really just have to trick them and<br>just a lot of positive energy<br>and stuff like that is that what you do yeah<br>and you just take their money and they sleep with you<br>that’s great damn<br>do you hear that<br>is uh the scientology have a thing with<br>fucking are you a lot of fuck<br>no yeah you’re a lot of fuck yeah<br>it’s all it is no you don’t have to be married or anything no<br>i don’t think so yeah when any new religion comes around<br>you can’t be i’m not scientologist by the way he’s lying<br>i think if i had to pick one religion<br>like if you had to do it i’d be buddhist<br>yeah that seems like<br>the one that makes the most sense but the problem with<br>being a buddhist<br>is you got to hang around with a bunch of fucking phonies<br>a bunch of people who are pretending to be buddhists you know<br>yeah they all smelly feet yeah looks like<br>it’s like the idea of hippies it’s all<br>good on paper<br>but the real problem with hippies is<br>you know they don’t want to work<br>they’re fucking lazy and stupid a lot of them and<br>you know it’s like<br>the stereotypes of like the pot smoking lazy you know<br>nair do wells like that’s<br>that’s like<br>accurate in a lot of ways that’s the real problem with hippies<br>you know<br>what’s buddhist women look like i don’t think<br>i’ve ever seen a buddhist women do good vegetarians<br>all right yeah<br>did they have like bald heads<br>no intros ladies and gentlemen<br>i gotta take a shit again<br>so i can’t believe this<br>we ate sausage subs at this local place<br>down the street they’re a little bit too strong<br>too powerful five hundred twenty four viewers<br>i

ridiculous<br>wasn’t even that interesting<br>but it is kind of interesting i put the picture up<br>you can go see the picture it’s on my twitter<br>what’s next<br>after a weekly rogan podcast in the book what’s next project<br>there are no next projects<br>this is about it this is about all we’re gonna do<br>a weekly podcast<br>we’re doing a show for sony it’s gonna be called<br>lfmao but no we might have to call it something different yeah<br>because we’ve been trying to do it for like two years and now<br>there’s a band called<br>lmale or something like that they’re close<br>we’ll come over the name for it but it’s basically<br>interviewing communions about the created process and<br>we’re also enter in the middle of coming up with another show<br>that it’s comedy related that i can’t talk about<br>but it should be fun that and just more shows more comedy<br>more good stuff is fear factor returning anytime no<br>it’s not<br>no there was a rumor that no<br>yeah there was a rumor for a while<br>they were gonna try to bring fear factor back<br>there’s fear factor when they canceled it was like<br>it was kind of like<br>they could have kept it going if they really wanted<br>i think that’s a show that could come back easily<br>i’ll do that shit<br>and if you did it without me<br>it wouldn’t have the flavor yeah<br>i’m sure it would probably be great<br>if they did it with mario lopez no<br>you can’t pass up on that easy money if you do that<br>especially if you’re working with all the same people again<br>stuff i might be willing to do it just for my kids just<br>put money away<br>what’s your movie kind<br>of<br>october<br>damn october should i move to colorado<br>i loved colorado man<br>sideshow sid said should i move to colorado<br>i fucking loved it<br>i would still be there i didn’t mind a cold i like the people<br>i like the sky i like the way<br>the fucking mountains looked i like the vibe<br>i liked everything<br>about it i liked it from me<br>creatively i liked living in colorado<br>but you know when you have<br>a family you have children you have a wife and<br>it’s not it’s not as easy as just me being by myself<br>it was out it was just me by myself i’d probably<br>still be there i’d still be on the top of that mountain<br>but<br>she was not into it it was just too creepy<br>when our dog got eaten our dog got eaten by a mountain line<br>that’s not like<br>a rumor that actually happened dog got eaten by a mountain line<br>and she’s bad driving in snow she crashed the car<br>so it was a couple different things<br>and then she got pregnant<br>and the pregnancy was the biggest reason<br>why we had to move out of colorado<br>it’s because we were<br>living over eight thousand feet<br>above sea level<br>it’s really hot<br>it’s like three or three thousand feet above boulder<br>and it’s a really really high altitude and when you’re pregnant<br>it’s just brutal<br>really it’s not good for you<br>it’s unhealthy for you and for the baby<br>colorado is like one of the highest<br>states in the country<br>like one of the top states in the country<br>when it comes to premature<br>births and a lot of it is because the altitude<br>just you don’t get enough air up there<br>it’s just it’s great for your conditioning<br>but it’s not so good for<br>being a pregnant woman<br>so all those factors<br>i had to move out of colorado but<br>if i could just be somewhere and live somewhere<br>live in colorado oh<br>in a heartbeat if i didn’t have to travel<br>stay in colorado or you know deal with snow when it comes hey<br>you’re fucking snowed in no big deal<br>that’s what it’s supposed to be like<br>the problem with me is i travel all the time so<br>i would leave my wife and leave the kids there it’s not the same<br>by myself i’d have no problem with it i loved it<br>so if you are gonna move somewhere and stay there<br>i would say yeah colorado’s fucking badass<br>it’s my favorite state<br>do you think there will be a time<br>when all handheld axes will have a pipe in them<br>like the tomahawk<br>is that what a tomahawks were<br>there were a pipe and an axe all in one<br>is that true<br>if that’s true the indians were bad motherfuckers<br>i don’t think<br>that’s i think that dude just went to a renaissance festival<br>and carried away<br>because i mean if you think about it if it was a pipe off well<br>listen this is the beauty of the internet right now<br>we’ll google this<br>did tomahawks have pipes on<br>i think there might have been a couple that did<br>but i don’t think the majority of that well<br>i speculate let’s find out<br>that just doesn’t seem right<br>it seems like it would just make the weapon<br>weaker having a hole through the middle of it yeah<br>that’s true it’s a good point<br>maybe it’s enough<br>yeah i’m gonna make pipe tomahawks<br>let’s say<br>pipe axis<br>the crazy crow trading post show me a pipe bags<br>these really pipes<br>historically accurate pipe axes<br>we have spent years researching and manufacturing the finest<br>line of throwing tomahawks<br>pipe tomahawks belt and camp axes available today<br>did you even know there was a market for that kind of shit<br>that’s the beautiful thing about the internet<br>let’s see what this thing looks like i don’t see the pipe part<br>where’s the pipe part<br>hand drilled for smoking wow<br>sounds like any hand forge iron head drilled for smoking<br>so basically the pipe is this<br>you put some tobacco up in that bitch right there<br>and you smoke right out of there<br>or do you smoke out of here<br>no i think you smoke out of there wow well<br>it just seems like i make<br>the handle weaker and the weapon weaker yeah<br>it’s what definitely would<br>but but this seems like it’s like really hardwood<br>look this one’s got a metal piece through it<br>original eighteen hundred to eighteen twenty five believe<br>to belong to red cloud<br>wow that’s pretty dope red cloud<br>didn’t think it out dude<br>i think we should start smoking pipe from a fucking tomahawk<br>we got to order one of those<br>come on man we’ll do the podcast we’ll smoke out of that<br>that’s ladies and gentlemen what say you on twitter<br>i need to order this right<br>i’m gonna order this add to basket listen click that’s right<br>that’s added to the basket<br>all right i’m gonna check out now i’ll check out later<br>because i don’t want you guys to get bummed out at me<br>it was boring enough looking for that toilet tree<br>coming up on two hours we just make this two hours<br>do you think why you getting bored huh<br>you don’t like it anymore no<br>i just think we should keep it two hours someone doesn’t like<br>the other video<br>someone doesn’t think it’s fun anymore<br>all right let’s go back<br>four and a seventy one motherfuckers in here<br>we lost a lot of people<br>for being really boring<br>yeah to see two hours of things is just about right<br>you want them wanting more not less<br>is that what we want ladies and gentlemen<br>is that is he right is he correct<br>i know for about two hours what is it<br>where’s the top left with every blinking light is right here<br>yeah we are i think after two hours also doesn’t<br>save maybe or something<br>i think after two hours people start hateness yeah<br>fucking faggots got nothing to talk about<br>boring ass shit<br>so so far we’ve answered questions we put photos up on twitter<br>we’ve talked about some heavy subjects<br>what more do you need ladies and gentlemen<br>we’re all living in an aliens petri dish says dockens twenty<br>maybe<br>you know that’s possible<br>it’s time and illusion<br>shred four thirty one wants to know if time’s an illusion<br>i don’t think it’s an illusion<br>i just don’t think time is just one thing<br>you tell that to david copperfield hmm<br>i think time is you know<br>i mean we already know that time changes when you go fast<br>like if someone’s in a super fast spaceship<br>you know and they go like a speed of light like time<br>goes by much quicker on earth than it doesn’t in their plane<br>so if they come back and they’re super fast spaceship<br>you know for them it’s only been a year<br>but for us<br>it could be like a hundred years depending on how far and fast<br>they go so time moves<br>in a way that i don’t i don’t i don’t think it’s<br>the way we look at it i don’t think it’s<br>as<br>cut and dry like<br>you know this is midnight and this is one o’clock i think it’s<br>it’s much more dependent upon the state that the<br>human beings and like<br>the frequency the persons and<br>where the person’s living<br>you know that you’re living on earth you know this dimension<br>you know that there’s<br>the time varies throughout other dimensions<br>and you can access those dimensions i mean<br>if they really do come up with ships<br>that can fly through space at you know close to speed<br>alive or something they really will be able to go<br>to a place where they’re literally going forward in time<br>they all have lived<br>one year<br>they come back to earth and hundreds of years have gone back<br>that’s just that’s nutty shit and that’s real<br>i don’t think we understand time enough<br>i think time is one of those things that<br>we think we got a grip on what it really is<br>but it’s probably far<br>more complex and confusing and variable than we think<br>i think we should get rid of daylight to savings time<br>because i think it’s bullshit that it’s fucking<br>pitch black outside and it’s only six thirty yes<br>he’s absolutely right farmers they’re all fucking thiefs what<br>how dare you yeah<br>but seriously what are you a giant melon camp hater back<br>then it made sense because everybody was a farmer you know<br>everything had to do with farmers<br>nowadays why didn’t they just get up earlier<br>i get it i don’t get it<br>everything<br>it makes sense i think you know if you have a regular job<br>you know sometimes it’s dark out<br>sometimes it’s light out the fucking earth spence<br>that’s what i love about arizona<br>the arizona they don’t change their time<br>they like fuck you yeah no<br>it’s stupid well<br>they need to even do it better than that they need to<br>really fuck it up like<br>i want it to be bright out to like nine to ten o’clock at night<br>don’t you think that’d be cool yeah<br>but then it would be dark out until like noon<br>yeah but that’s fine no<br>it’s retarded i’m just as retarded as that<br>it makes no sense most people would rather like to<br>have a day like i don’t know<br>many people would rather have daylight when they get off work<br>don’t you think<br>i think that’s silly<br>i think it’s silly<br>i spell twitter long round my link i know i did<br>i think i can fix it though i think it’s too late<br>it is<br>it is what it is<br>now you don’t get there what do you do that other program<br>oh that’s right<br>that’s a little motherfucker right here checks our shit<br>right in there right<br>it’s not<br>yeah it’s just never sharing the whole thing why is it marshall<br>because it’s like two lines you know what i mean<br>if you hit the right button<br>say right yeah<br>put it a joe log<br>yay<br>i fix that shit<br>didn’t change<br>all right<br>this guy’s trying to be funny<br>steve whizzy trying to be funny steve whizzy<br>says besides carlos menseia who are your other favorite<br>you don’t like carlos menseida why<br>that’s what does make sense these are being a silly goose<br>my favorite comedians though for real<br>are guys why i look forward to seeing like louis c k<br>david tale dougstan hope definitely<br>there’s a riser<br>cat williams<br>i<br>see him live only see him on video<br>cat williams was on tmz yesterday<br>he just got out of jail or something like that<br>and he got in a fight at a bar and he had a gun in his pocket<br>i like it he’s crazy<br>cats crazy<br>yeah he’s crazy for real<br>i want to meet that dude<br>i thought i like his comedy i think he’s very funny<br>jerry listen to him on<br>grand theft auto no is he good yeah<br>he does like the voice well no<br>they have a comedy club in grand theft auto you can go in and<br>watch comedy<br>i like it<br>if not telepathy what’s next for human evolution<br>johnny bananas twenty one wants to know boobs for men<br>if not telepathy<br>what snacks for human evolution probably<br>a reversal if if it not telepathy if we we’re<br>i think we’re in a race right now<br>between technology and retards between technology<br>and caveman style living<br>you know they’re talking about invading pakistan<br>invading yemen and more war and more craziness<br>you know we’re at<br>a crossroads and i think we could either get hit by a meteor<br>or blow ourselves up or<br>figure out the next level figure out what<br>what’s going to take human beings<br>from where we are to the next stage of existence<br>which is like a real thing<br>i mean i think we’re really going to evolve<br>we’re really moving toward something new<br>you know i think that’s what this<br>this frantic fucking society we live in is all about i think<br>we’re pushing and moving toward something<br>all working together<br>toward something and i think it’s gonna be technology driven<br>so it’s one of those things either that’s gonna happen<br>there’s gonna be some sort of a<br>technologically<br>birthed<br>connection that all people<br>all the sudden share some sort of a<br>some sort of a convergence<br>of all human being it’s either gonna be that<br>or it’s gonna be we blow ourselves up<br>or a meteor fucks us up or yellowstone explodes<br>and we start from scratch<br>you know<br>what if what if in the future the first robot to get pregnant<br>imagine imagine you figure out a way to get machines so<br>closely tuned into human beings<br>that you can fuck them and get them pregnant yeah<br>i think that’s very possible man<br>don’t you anything’s possible at this point<br>that’s not that crazy<br>you know i mean they can make so many things<br>artificially they figured out a way to make pork<br>in a laboratory<br>actual the meat they could take some of the meat from a pig<br>and they make an elaboratory the problem is it’s not<br>really like mushy because it doesn’t exercise at all<br>and it’s not like it’s not like taught sinew<br>but they’re trying to figure out a way to maybe<br>electrically exercise<br>the muscle you could literally like<br>just make gigantic like rooms full of meat<br>you know that doesn’t even have a life attached to it<br>if they can do that<br>if they can do that<br>why can’t they if they can<br>figure out a way to grow meat<br>why can’t they<br>figure out a way to make an artificial human being<br>that’s gonna be just like blade runner though<br>they’re gonna be all sad and shit<br>they don’t want to kill you hahaha<br>you know<br>I mean you have to give emotions<br>if you don’t give them emotions then you know<br>they can’t relate to people<br>they can’t empathize with people<br>then they just go on mad raping and killing sprees<br>because if you make artificial people<br>what if you make them<br>they get hard ons and should<br>you know my calculator has a boner fucked by a robot<br>imagine<br>I mean if you make the females you can make males too<br>like for like old gay dudes<br>you know like<br>dudes would want<br>you know like to have a robot fuck doll<br>right but gay dudes would want some<br>robot gay dude that they can fuck<br>you know can you imagine if they could make a real live<br>like say if there’s a guy who was your neighbor<br>who was really creepy and he was fixated on you<br>and he make a robot that looks exactly like you<br>and just fuck it all day long<br>and punch it and tie it up and shit on its head<br>and there’s nothing you can do about it<br>so literally next door<br>to your fucking house<br>this guy’s like<br>putting<br>the robot head out the window and waving to you<br>look look I’m pissing his mouth and it’s like you<br>but it’s a fake you<br>and he’s just fucking it up all day<br>how disturbing would that be<br>there’s nothing you can do about it<br>do you have the papers on this<br>it’s on a real human sir and they show the papers okay<br>I guess it’s a robot<br>I mean if it’s a robot right<br>look if I have a grappling dummy in<br>my garage that I use and I practice my jujutu<br>you know and you could practice positions on it<br>it’s like it’s called above a dummy it’s a gracie<br>you can buy from<br>the gracie academy and torrents<br>they’re the ones who start selling their website<br>I forget what the website is<br>but if you look up bubba dummy<br>it’s a dummy that’s just a san frigid jitsu<br>and we filmed once<br>playing around<br>remember we’re in the<br>in the garage<br>we are beaten to shit out of it and kick it in<br>what if that was a real person<br>I mean it’s a dummy that we made<br>but what if it’s a robot person<br>what if there’s like a robot person<br>that you could practice jujitsu on<br>you could rape him<br>you could punch him in the face<br>you could just beat the shit out of him<br>you could chop his arms off<br>he’d be screaming and yelling and the cops come in<br>you look at the fake person<br>yeah but the laws would have to probably change<br>that artifact intelligence is just the same<br>you know because then I mean wow<br>yeah because I mean a dog<br>isn’t as smart as a human but you’re not gonna<br>let it chop the dog’s legs off and stuff<br>you make a robot that has artificial intelligence<br>it’s still gonna be considered artificial intelligence<br>I think<br>yeah but do you think<br>they’ll treated the same way as a human being<br>like I think if the laws it’ll be like murder right<br>I think if it<br>can think it’s gonna be considered life<br>but<br>before they figure that out there’s gonna be a little<br>oh yeah we’ve been a couple years of master Maine<br>next romance we<br>have a direct<br>replica view and he’s gonna<br>fuck its mouth right in front of your window<br>right he’s gonna blow an air harp manee<br>look out the window<br>what the fuck is he doing you looking these<br>fucking your head right<br>and you think about it like what if that was me<br>what if I was the duplicate<br>and the real me was watching me get raped<br>it’s weird shit that could be real that could be real<br>that could really be a possibility<br>you know what I’m surprised is that<br>there’s not technology yet where<br>we can I could<br>have a program<br>and type out shit and make it sound exactly like you<br>yeah like you know like you<br>listen to your voice and do the exact levels<br>so like you can prank call with your mom<br>you know<br>something like that is there should be that already<br>this should be that<br>totally yeah why haven’t they figured that out<br>yeah it seems easy<br>you know what’s really ridiculous to<br>is that you still have to sign things<br>you scribble your name<br>how damn yeah<br>and this is stupid<br>because I mean I write taco or a penis<br>they don’t even care<br>they don’t look at it they don’t check your I need no<br>I don’t sign my credit cards<br>I guess if you look at my driver’s license<br>I scribble my name on that<br>it’s a similar scribble<br>but what are these fucking people that work at target<br>are they scribble experts<br>yeah then you can look at that scribble I don’t know<br>this is not the same guy<br>yeah sometimes I write full sentences honest to god<br>yeah it’s ridiculous<br>how is that still around this<br>you write something<br>with your name and that’s legally binding<br>if you write something with your name you know I mean<br>like you know<br>when I got married<br>I had to get a marriage certificate and you had a right<br>scribble<br>that’s what ties you up when you write it right<br>you see I would do that<br>see I would write this is not real<br>and but they’re scribble<br>because then I tend to go to my hood<br>yeah if I get a divorce I got no serve<br>you could see I wrote this is not void on it<br>I wonder if that would stand up<br>that was not valid<br>I don’t know maybe<br>maybe you could say at it it’s like shit<br>or that could say well we have<br>we have the documents you signed<br>then you could look at and go look what I wrote<br>yeah it says this is not real<br>married maybe just sign I do not agree to this<br>I’m a gun is being held up to my head right now<br>yeah so much time<br>they have my dog hostage<br>robots will have rights after a while<br>so that’s a guy watched that will smith movie<br>ai no ai too<br>I so they need to make an ai movie like with the kid<br>but like like you know sex<br>was it I am robot yeah I am robot<br>that was<br>that was pretty good movie that’s a good movie<br>everything was mac<br>remember all the robots look like macs yeah<br>does gilbert ivo have a chance against those santos<br>this guy’s talking about<br>I’m out here against ufc<br>is that when you leave<br>you won’t talk about ufc<br>we’ll answer one eoc question yes he does<br>gilbert either is dangerous<br>he’s<br>a really good striker he’s a dangerous motherfucker<br>and he knows this is a big opportunity for him<br>he’s gonna come charge and guns blazing<br>don’t you think it’s stupid<br>when people ask he’s gonna win the fight<br>because obviously it’s a fight for a reason<br>meaning that there’s not an obvious<br>winner of this fight<br>so most of the time is not an obvious winner but most<br>of the time I mean there’s a lot of times when when<br>everybody agrees that a certain guy’s gonna win<br>I mean it doesn’t mean that you’re right<br>but in this fight<br>this guy doesn’t know that much<br>about this gilbert ivo guy probably<br>and you know he wonders<br>I think gilbert’s got a real good chance<br>he’s dangerous if he trains hard<br>if he’s in real good shape he’s<br>very very dangerous he knocks a lot of guys out<br>his knockout of gary good rich in<br>pride was like<br>one of the most spectacular knockouts ever<br>head kicked them<br>boomed one shot like<br>10 seconds into the fight and put them asleep<br>you know those questions though<br>you can ask a dog to bark once for yes<br>and bark two for no<br>and they have the same<br>percentage of the outcome of the question and<br>the answer that you know what I mean<br>like if you say yeah that person’s gonna win<br>well I never say someone’s gonna win<br>but someone’s<br>I’ll tell you if someone’s good or not<br>you don’t know if someone’s gonna win<br>okay no more sports questions<br>order it I’m gonna order that<br>the tomahawk pipe<br>next broadcast hopefully if they get it to me in time<br>we will have a tomahawk pipe<br>I think that’s a fucking awesome item<br>like you need another pipe<br>I need a tom awk like a motherfucker<br>that would be kind of cool I<br>think especially since it’s a direct<br>replica<br>of something from a dude named red cloud<br>oh there you go look at those fanny packs<br>they have oh they have a sweet fanny pack<br>look at that let’s meet out of a quilt<br>oh that’s like a shoulder bag<br>I don’t do shoulder bags that’s what goddamn purse<br>okay fanny pack is fucking manly<br>that’s a manly shit<br>all right<br>let’s go to the rogan board and see questions there<br>why is fanny pack manly<br>I’ll tell you why fanny packs manly<br>because if you’re wearing a fanny pack first of all<br>you’re saying I don’t give a<br>fuck what you think about how I look<br>you know you just<br>slapping this big stupid gay thing around your waist<br>you’re like whatever<br>I have two hands free<br>and I’m happy I’m not trying to look good for you<br>I’m not trying to fuck you<br>I’m not trying to get you to be my friend<br>I like having all my shit in a bag that cannot get laid<br>yeah I’m not trying to get laid<br>so if people talk about oh<br>man how can you wear a fanny pack<br>that’s okay it’s a bag that connects to my waist<br>this is silly<br>the only reason<br>why you don’t think it’s good looking<br>is because women think it’s disgusting<br>and women think it looks gay<br>so women have<br>figured out a way to<br>bully guys<br>into not wearing it by telling us that looks gay<br>why would you care what kind of a bag another man wears<br>dear unless he’s wearing a<br>bright pink hello kitty strap<br>it covers up your crotch yeah<br>it does cover up my crotch<br>it’s right there<br>so if there’s like a micrometer<br>there comes from outer space<br>and could potentially<br>hit me in the dick<br>it’s gonna hit myself on first or perhaps my wallet<br>it’s right there<br>it’s easy for travel<br>when I go to the airport I unbuckle that thing<br>bang put it on my car keys are in there<br>my cell phones in there woo<br>fanny packs of the shit sun<br>that would be cool of gay people love the smell farts<br>didn’t joe joke about that for a while<br>this fella says<br>why are you gonna come to the east coast of Canada<br>I don’t like the east coast of Canada I’m just kidding<br>we were in Montreal<br>last April that was fun<br>I’ll be back<br>I’ll definitely be back up there<br>all right page two<br>we were going to the rogan board right now<br>to answer questions<br>what do I think about jersey shore<br>I don’t like<br>jersey shore as much as I thought I would like it<br>because I knew too many dudes like that growing up<br>to me it’s like more annoying and stupid<br>it’s fun for like a couple seconds so you fish pump<br>you know but after a while it’s just<br>it’s fake<br>this is my theory am I talking to my theory no<br>I think kind of like when the hills first came out<br>everyone thought that was real<br>then slowly<br>got to the point where everyone figured out it was<br>a fake show that’s filmed to look real<br>I think jersey sure is real<br>yeah they’re way too dumb to add but did you know<br>half of them are<br>like male strippers that had to audition<br>like they’re all in the entertainment field<br>it’s called jersey shore instead of the hills<br>you know I bet you anything<br>and the years of that yeah<br>I bet you anything<br>and they all live in this house<br>it’s really nice like real world house<br>yeah you know what I mean but that’s the real people<br>it’s really a genius show<br>if you look at it that way right<br>but I think in three years we’re all gonna be like<br>knowing it’s fake like that fight<br>somehow’s fake and everything I really<br>the wasn’t fake when I do punch that girl in the face<br>yeah unless that chick is like a<br>you know stomp woman and they fucking<br>practiced it for like 50 years you know<br>I don’t know<br>if they practiced the punch a lot you know<br>hmm<br>I mean you look at movies and you look at that punch<br>it looks real<br>they filmed it like to look fake<br>hmm I don’t know<br>I think<br>that dude got drunk and punched that bitch in the case<br>listen someone said<br>would I have full blown<br>aids or spend one year in mark hayden’s body pick one<br>well<br>you know what full blown aids you could recover from<br>you know be having one year in marcadan’s body<br>it would probably be torture<br>I think full blownades<br>if you take your vitamins probably be okay<br>in a couple of weeks<br>dude you spend one year in markaden’s body<br>fuck every chicken could possibly fuck<br>you’re not gonna fuck any of aids<br>you’re not gonna fuck anybody in markaden’s body<br>you don’t get aids in markating’s body<br>you don’t even understand the question<br>no I’m saying if you have one year in his body<br>you could just abuse it like<br>fuck and get the fuck out of there<br>one year that’s ridiculous<br>how dare you<br>let’s end this<br>let’s end this<br>all right a couple more questions<br>then we’re gonna need the fuck out of here<br>I got to admit some of these questions are really lame<br>but it could be that we’re really high<br>and they just seem lame<br>that’s us distinct possibility<br>which adds more coffee right now<br>I apologize for the wackass internet<br>I really am gonna fix that<br>should I go at amp t<br>u verse or should I go comcast cable charter<br>charter charter<br>see anybody know<br>well this guy says I think red band’s life is fake<br>how about that fella cho jin two k<br>he says fake he says your life is fake<br>I think he said your face is fake<br>his face is his screen names fake<br>lucky didn’t you have a picture<br>let’s just die what would happen what<br>it’s fake anon fake anon’s not funny<br>no<br>look at this this is the laziest rapist ever<br>dave broomfield at hotmail<br>com says hey joe rogan<br>why don’t you invite me to come<br>trip with you in your isolation tank<br>how lazy is he<br>that’s not how you stock and rape somebody son<br>it’s gonna you’re gonna take it’s gonna<br>you’re gonna have to be a little more clever than that<br>that’s ridiculous<br>fuck how kind of this<br>we got a fake brett rogers<br>hey joe roger did you see my last fight<br>no fake brett rogers I didn’t<br>but rogers is not on Twitter<br>ladies and gentlemen that’s a fake bet rogers<br>the rail bet<br>rogers is a bad motherfucker but that’s not him<br>but it was really funny when the fake brett rogers<br>was having an argument with a real<br>war machine<br>that was pretty funny<br>war machine didn’t get it<br>thought it was all really happening<br>brian you stop talking a while ago<br>what happened have you given up on us<br>yeah<br>I get to the cutoff point where I’m just<br>tired of staring at computer yeah<br>while having a company in indian headdress to go with<br>my tomahawk pipe<br>says amuse 90<br>94 yeah that’s a very good question<br>and I think yes I think if we’re gonna really<br>get in touch with spirit world we’re<br>gonna need full indian entire do you think<br>yeah we’re gonna need the whole thing<br>man we’re gonna need<br>feathers and shit and<br>the you know the correct type of weed<br>gotta make sure we only smoke<br>what the indian smoke smell<br>our condoms smoke<br>no not those indians american indians<br>not india indians<br>did I see the girl mosh pit<br>I washed it for a couple seconds but it was like<br>one of those<br>terrorist videos where they cut some dude’s head off<br>after a while<br>I like just shut it off<br>let’s see if any of these questions don’t suck<br>I think if anything came out of this<br>somewhere someone right now is thinking about designing<br>robot where you clone your neighbor<br>and make a robot out of them<br>and then fuck them and rape them in front of them<br>somebody<br>somebody is thinking about that and I think<br>if this chat has done anything good for the world<br>it’s introduced that idea<br>that possibility out there<br>of making a call in a view<br>you know what’s gonna suck is<br>we’re gonna be like 90 years old<br>and they’re gonna make the<br>perfect fuck robot<br>but we’re gonna be so old<br>we’re not gonna even care anymore<br>we’re just gonna get the<br>I don’t even want pushy<br>I’ll tell you that it was ruining my life<br>yeah yeah<br>I guess but they’ll probably have more problems<br>than than we have now<br>you know we’ll probably look back on these days<br>and oh remember the simple times<br>you just get on the internet and drive to work<br>you have to worry about monsters and aliens and<br>ufos and fucking<br>you know the hyena flu that’s killing everybody lately<br>you know<br>that’s the next one<br>something scary like pig food doesn’t scare ya<br>bird flu that doesn’t scare<br>the fucking<br>hyena flu is gonna scare the shit out of you<br>you know it’s a flu that came from hyena it’s holy shit<br>yeah from from eating their own young<br>they came up with a fucking crazy new flu and it’s<br>everyone who gets it dies<br>i’m gonna be wearing<br>what beekeepers outfits everywhere<br>fucking mask first cat in california last week<br>got the first h one in one<br>reeling peopleday cat<br>so maybe it’s gonna be cats<br>we’re gonna have to kill our cats<br>or something like that<br>after you have a baby cats become just really annoying<br>even dogs are annoying like shut the fuck up steepie<br>baby’s rule<br>dogs I still like cats<br>my cat started pissing in my office right after<br>my child was born<br>transparent little cunt<br>so obvious what she wanted<br>dirty little bitch<br>couple more questions here let’s go to the robin board<br>see if we got a good question there<br>do you ever get mad like in anything<br>actually piss you off to the point where rogan smashed<br>I get upset it has to be pretty fucking a bad situation<br>get me that upset I’m<br>pretty rational and it comes to most things<br>I have a I mean<br>everyone has the ability to freak out or something<br>it’s just whether or not you choose to let yourself get<br>there you know<br>just gotta make sure<br>I think the most important<br>thing about not getting mad is manage your biology<br>you got to treat your biology like it’s a bank account<br>and if you have you know if you’re in debt<br>you know you owe it something<br>if you know you’re overdrafted<br>you you owe yourself an expenditure of energy<br>you know especially if you have a certain type of body<br>if you have a<br>muscular body<br>if you have a person who’s<br>engaged in athletics your whole life<br>you have a body that’s used to exerting a lot of energy<br>when you owe it to that body<br>you have to like you have to a debt to pay<br>and if you don’t pay that debt<br>you’re going to have a problem<br>where you’re going to have too much energy<br>that’s stored up and built in and not blown out<br>and it’s going to come out in<br>unusual ways looking traffic or at work<br>or whatever<br>you’ll start<br>screaming and freaking out about something<br>you really didn’t need to<br>and really it’s all just about managing your biology<br>managing your thoughts<br>it’s very important to have some down time<br>where you can sit alone by yourself and just think<br>that’s very very important for me the<br>isolation tank does that like times 100<br>that’s my favorite<br>but sometimes even just sitting on the couch and just<br>by myself just thinking<br>you know you can call it meditation<br>you can call it whatever the fuck you want<br>just spending time<br>to organize your thoughts and put your mind<br>in a certain place<br>put your body in a certain place with exercise<br>with yoga with nutrition all that shit’s important<br>you gotta manage your biology<br>and when you manage your biology<br>it makes managing your mind much<br>much easier managing your mind managing your biology<br>that’s the key to not getting upset of things<br>you fucking faggots what<br>okay the best art is created from the starving artist<br>it seems that this is a good question<br>it seems the best art is created from the starving<br>artist being wealthy<br>do you feel it hurts your ability to create art<br>comedy or do you believe that<br>not having<br>to worry about your financial well<br>being allows you more<br>time to be creative<br>that’s a very good question<br>I think a lot of times people<br>are much more ambitious when they’re starving<br>they have much more energy<br>they have much more<br>dedication towards something<br>but that doesn’t mean<br>that you can’t have a lot of dedication<br>towards something<br>when you become successful<br>it all depends on what was your motivation in the first<br>place<br>if your motivation in the first place was recognition<br>and adulation<br>then you become famous and<br>then you get that<br>then you have no motivation to keep going<br>but if your motivation is<br>the actual art itself is creating new things<br>then I think you can be more free<br>as you become successful because<br>you’re in a position<br>where you don’t have to worry about money anymore<br>so you have one less thing to think about<br>and you’re ambitious in the sense of being creative<br>instead of concentrating on money<br>your mind is not<br>geared on that your mind is geared on the art<br>that’s how I like to think that I am<br>and when I’m at my best<br>that is where I’m at<br>that’s my mind frame<br>you know that’s<br>my point of reference is that I think about<br>the creation of the art itself<br>that’s when I’m at my best<br>if I think about money and I think about like<br>how much is this going to pay me<br>and is this worth this<br>it’s not the same motivation<br>so it’s you don’t get the same result<br>it’s not the same passion to it<br>the passion’s got to be real it’s got to be<br>my comedy the way in my head<br>my motivation is all about whether or not people<br>enjoy it<br>I don’t want to do anything that people don’t enjoy<br>I want to make sure that everything that I’m creating<br>I’m creating it so other people<br>get enjoyment out of it<br>that’s the reward that you get for that<br>as long as you’re concentrating on that<br>you do no wrong as long as you have<br>the dynamic in the relationship between<br>you and the audience<br>as long as you respect that and as long as your<br>relationship to the creativity is all<br>based on just producing more stuff<br>that’s good that people enjoy<br>as long as you’re doing it<br>for that reason<br>I don’t think you have to worry about<br>money robbing you of your enthusiasm<br>but if you were just in it for the money and just<br>in it for the adulation yeah<br>you become successful<br>and then all of a sudden<br>like you’re not going to want to do it anymore<br>you’re not going to be<br>enthusiastic about it anymore<br>higher flu equal super aids<br>yeah so I’m talking about<br>what do I plan on doing<br>December twenty first two thousand twelve<br>no I’m gonna stay<br>if it’s really what peoples are<br>you gonna go to the Pyramids man<br>if it’s really what<br>some people think it is<br>this convergence is technological convergence where all<br>human beings will<br>interface with each other<br>where someone creates a time machine where some<br>huge technological breakthrough happens<br>if that’s what some people think<br>December twenty first two thousand twelve<br>yelling collider<br>or whatever that shit’s called the hydron collider<br>I think that’s about the time and it’s gonna<br>if that’s the case and it doesn’t matter where you are<br>right you should be amongst friends have a gun nearby<br>maybe brian and I will<br>do a u stream that day<br>should we commit to 24h<br>let’s commit to a u stream right now<br>we’re going to commit to a u stream for<br>December twenty first two thousand twelve<br>right no not really<br>I think it’s different times in Miami well<br>in chichinitza the same as Miami<br>okay it’s just a little bit below that<br>either way December 20th, 16012<br>bride and I are committing right now to a u strain<br>we’re gonna do it<br>feel strong about that<br>yeah nothing’s gonna happen<br>maybe maybe not just gonna happen<br>that is a possibility<br>you know I think people<br>like to know that something’s gonna happen<br>we have a friend that likes to believe in ufos and<br>psychics and<br>kem trails and anything<br>anything wacky<br>this dude is just jumps on board you know and I think<br>it’s just as possible that nothing’s gonna happen<br>I think that’s more impossible than it’s not<br>gonna happen you know<br>I think it’s possible that something might happen<br>on the day because<br>everybody’s thinking something’s gonna happen<br>on the day right<br>if it’s some<br>dude sitting somewhere with some bombs I don’t<br>even think that<br>I think you know the idea<br>that we’re gonna force something to happen<br>by really concentrating it as a<br>you know as a point of focus<br>this is one point<br>yeah but that’s what<br>everyone thought it’s gonna happen in 2000<br>that is true<br>but everybody was waiting for the clocks to break in<br>2000<br>was a very specific day rains following from the sky<br>fucking computer stop working man<br>I stayed home<br>I’m embrace stayed home<br>that was one of the first<br>1st years where I didn’t do a new year show<br>because I think I probably was worried<br>it’s so weird is that everyone was really<br>freaked out about that<br>and then we had all this like built up<br>stress because of it and then<br>just shortly after 9 11<br>is like then we finally got the release<br>all the stress like the world’s ending text<br>I just remember being really stressed out<br>thinking something was gonna happen<br>it seems like right after that nylon<br>all right that’s quick<br>it brains much easy to give up<br>two and a half hours brian doesn’t take vitamins<br>2h min too much I ate a bag of carrots today<br>I have a juicer now oh man<br>a bag of carrots<br>well we’ve dropped down to four in the 23 viewers<br>what that says to me is<br>at least 100 y motherfuckers thought we were boring as<br>shit yeah<br>so I think that<br>how harry is my butt from one to 10 how dare you sir<br>how dare you big two two thug<br>from one to 10 my butt<br>three three or four<br>I really could use shaving and trimming<br>I was listening to an old towered stern broadcast<br>where they were find<br>and he was fine for talking about shavings but<br>you know you don’t realize how crazy<br>those fucking<br>regular radio shows are like what you can and can’t do<br>into you hear something like that<br>but it was inspiring and I was thinking about<br>trimming my own butt hair<br>but it could definitely help<br>solar flares are not in our control<br>and that’s the thing to worry about says raptor 94<br>raptor 94 things that solar flares are gonna do us in<br>fair possible man<br>nobody fucking no slayer is a gay<br>make brian clean my room for the next used dream<br>that’s just my other desk it’s covered with shit<br>it’s a desk but I really use it as like<br>a place to just leave shit<br>I’m a<br>slob<br>I have problems las gentlemen<br>do do do do do do<br>what bullshit resolutions will you say<br>you will keep and won’t<br>no I don’t make resolutions<br>and it’s not a girl because I’m not a fucking girl<br>and<br>if I wanted to fix something about myself I would start<br>now I wouldn’t wait<br>I always say I’m gonna work out more<br>this year I’m gonna fucking get my shirt together<br>but for the most part<br>I put out as much energy as I want to put out<br>I focus on things as much<br>as much as I can while still enjoying them<br>you know<br>always dancing around obsession<br>that’s very important<br>to me whether it’s with comedy or anything else<br>and with games with anything in my life<br>I always have to dance around becoming<br>obsessed with things<br>so for me it’s just<br>just enjoy just<br>try to be balanced and try to consciously<br>you know just try to have a good time<br>be positive when I get obsessed with things<br>whether it’s about<br>jitsu or comedy or<br>playing games like pool or video games<br>I get crazy about things<br>and I don’t I don’t like that feeling<br>I don’t like getting obsessed with things<br>brian you get obsessed with jerking off right<br>no I do tell you<br>how much point do you have<br>I get obsessed with internet though for sure<br>it feels like I constantly want more information<br>about everything<br>and it just branches off more and more and more like<br>I’ll be looking about what<br>with how apple sauce is made<br>but then I need to know about how the apples are grown<br>you know and just keep on going and going and going<br>yeah that wasn’t that way when you were kid right<br>no no at all I<br>fucking hated reading<br>and I didn’t want to learn anything<br>I just wanted to play video games and<br>isn’t it funny how different when you get older<br>your idea of information<br>changes because when I was a kid information<br>it always meant school meant shit<br>you have to learn<br>meant boring meant suck<br>you know they were all connected together<br>but then when it’s no longer a requirement then<br>you find out what you’re actually interested in<br>you pursue those things<br>you know yeah<br>right<br>brian just fucking fall asleep on me<br>believe that shit<br>the fuck alright my Twitter friends<br>I think we’re gonna answer one more question<br>and we’re gonna<br>he’s fake snoring like the goddamn three stooges<br>what the f is that mo<br>are you doing mo<br>I’m gonna end this curly<br>it might have been curling it might be right<br>4012 something very subtle may happen<br>that we don’t realize for a while<br>dude<br>dude<br>what say it say it<br>go smoke your aol disk and get off the internet<br>something subtles happening right now<br>we will recognize for a while<br>that’s not what 2012 supposed to be<br>if that’s what happens then 2012 was bullshit<br>then it’s 100% bullshit<br>if December twenty first<br>two thousand twelve rolls around we just go<br>nothing I don’t feel anything I don’t feel a thing<br>then it’s bullshit 100%<br>it’s not like oh man no there’s a change<br>you’re just not gonna realize it for a while<br>no it’s supposed to be<br>bam it’s supposed to be open a door<br>here’s a new thing<br>you know I mean<br>if the internet turned on<br>like if there was a day that the internet turned on<br>we all looked back and said<br>oh December 10th, 2000 or nineteen ninety three<br>that’s when the internet turned on<br>the world changed forever<br>if there was like a recognized date<br>first of all that would be way more<br>important than fucking Columbus day<br>how about that<br>how about we study Columbus day and that dude<br>never even landed in america right<br>who was in the fucking Bahamas<br>raping and murdering people and shit<br>you know and then Columbus day<br>the internet day is a way<br>bigger day<br>for american history than fucking Columbus day<br>if they came out with an internet day<br>that would be important<br>but<br>December twenty first two thousand twelve has<br>to be like that internet day<br>it has to be a day where we look back and go wow<br>that day some shit started off<br>that’s the day that changed everything<br>that’s what<br>December twenty first two thousand twelve has gotta be<br>all the hype behind it<br>if it’s not that then it’s bullshit<br>you know this whole idea that it’s the end of an age<br>so it’s becoming a<br>new era maybe maybe possibly<br>but to me that could just as easily happen tomorrow<br>or I mean why<br>do we assume that the mayans were absolutely correct<br>about that even if they were correcting<br>recognizing that human beings<br>go in cycles you know<br>that’s not an old idea<br>the yugas is<br>and I believe<br>hindu idea I think it’s hindu along the same lines<br>there’s like stages that humanity goes for goes through<br>and that these stages<br>these cycles that they’re all repeatable<br>they just keep happening again<br>a cycle over and over again<br>just like how you breathe in you always breathe out<br>humanity rises and falls<br>and right now we’re supposed to<br>be in kali yuga and it’s also supposed to end<br>the same time around where the mayans believe that<br>this age is going to end<br>and at the same time we’re terrence mckenna’s<br>you know time waves zero novelty theory<br>which a lot of people think is bullshit<br>I don’t know if it’s bullshit or not<br>but there was a guy named<br>terrence mckenna that had this crazy<br>mathematical algorithm designed to track time<br>and it was based off the each ing<br>and the idea was that you could apply<br>this to past events and show that all human innovation<br>that progress in humanity is all like<br>you could chart it on a graph<br>that it’s all like going along a certain direction<br>and that eventually<br>was going to reach a point of what he called<br>ultimate novelty<br>and the idea of ultimate novelty would be<br>something that we would figure out<br>or do<br>like create a time machine or something like that<br>that would literally change everything<br>as we know it<br>you know<br>and that ray kurtzwill calls it the singularity<br>you know that there’s a bunch of different<br>scientists that believe<br>we’re moving towards this convergence<br>this one big invention<br>and they tie that into the mind<br>thing that December twenty first two thousand twelve<br>is exactly the same as the ending point for<br>ultimate novelty for time wave zero<br>and that terrence mckenna arrived at that time<br>completely independent of the my encounter<br>I don’t know if<br>it’s bullshit<br>you don’t have really studied it either right dude he<br>studied you about this whole thing<br>and he just programmed this logic around that day<br>is possible it was possible<br>it didn’t seem like he was a liar though<br>he might have been kind of a hippie and he’s a hippie<br>they’re all lies<br>they almost money so they could buy weed and<br>fucking truly<br>truly maybe we don’t know if it was<br>what we do know is<br>this fucking thing’s been going on for 2h 30min<br>and that’s it<br>it’s over ladies and gentlemen<br>brian and I are gonna go get something to eat<br>and we’re gonna sign out<br>we’re gonna try to do this every week now<br>2h every week 2h min and a half you’re right<br>2h is not so good<br>but 2h and a half is not so good now<br>2h is the perfect point now<br>but we appreciate all 400 and fucking whatever of you<br>we had 500 people at one point in time<br>book it’s like a comedy club and as soon as we<br>get some more internet in here we’re gonna start<br>triple broadcasting it on both justin<br>tv and all the other one<br>yeah we’ll put it on three and we’ll also<br>we’ll give you different angles to yeah<br>different angles<br>if you want to be a fucking weirdo<br>you know<br>can we get bigger heads up a couple days yes<br>my friend jim dirkson did<br>no did rick diddrixon<br>jim diddrixon<br>yeah we will we’ll definitely give more advance time<br>we just figured it out yesterday<br>we’re gonna do it<br>then I put it up<br>and said we’re gonna do it a couple hours<br>but what we’ll do next time is<br>what we’re eventually going to do<br>is have a specific time<br>we start at every week<br>that sounds like a Wednesday yeah<br>Wednesday and afternoons<br>yeah yeah you’re right because<br>even if we go on the road for comedy we don’t leave<br>until Thursday usually<br>so we’ll do we’ll try to do a Tuesday or a Wednesday<br>and that’s what we’ll do<br>we’ll do like<br>late afternoon in la<br>like 3:00 is perfect somewhere around that line<br>and we’ll do it on a regular basis<br>so this week I’m at<br>the house of blues on<br>Saturday no yeah<br>Saturday night the house Friday night<br>the house of blues<br>this Friday in vegas<br>that’s January first<br>there’s still tickets available for that<br>new year’s eve in melrose<br>the
