dare you it’s not a stash<br>this is medicine<br>it’s this is called train wreck<br>you see right there and you see right there<br>this if you don’t know if you’re from out of town<br>that red cross in the marijuana leave<br>this is medical<br>marijuana so this is totally legal in the state of california<br>it’s pretty trippy because<br>you drive down the street<br>and i was driving down the street yesterday<br>and we were looking for places<br>where we could<br>you know like we could see how many places are near my house<br>there’s like fucking<br>twenty places within a<br>couple miles of my house that i can go<br>and a lot of them they just say<br>collective on it they’ll say like<br>you know west hills collective or you know<br>fucking dick street collective whatever<br>and it’ll have a red cross and that’s all you need to know<br>and everybody knows that it’s weed they have green letters<br>everybody uses green letters<br>and they’re everywhere and you go<br>and if you have one of these right here<br>this is brian’s if you see this<br>this is a real legitimate recommendation from a doctor and this<br>all you do is you go to a doctor you say<br>marijuana helps me sleep whatever<br>and the doctor will give you one of these<br>legitimate recommendations<br>a legal prescription in the state of california from marijuana<br>and then you go to these places and<br>some of them<br>you can pay with a fucking credit card it’s the trippiest thing<br>ever<br>you buy weed with a credit card and you’re like<br>what year is this<br>it’s two thousand and nine<br>but the rest of the country is still living in the dark ages<br>colorado is catching up colorado has a bunch of places now<br>colorado actually is going to open up<br>medical marijuana restaurant<br>and they’re gonna open up some thirty thousand square foot weed<br>superstore and boulders<br>fucking gigantic it’s like three stories isn’t texas<br>even doing like a vote soon or yes<br>yeah<br>a lot of people are trying you know a lot of states are trying<br>massachusetts recently made it they decriminalized it it was<br>they don’t have any medical law yet there<br>but now it’s completely<br>not legal but it’s not illegal<br>it’s a weird thing like<br>you’re not allowed to sell it like possession is one thing<br>but selling it<br>is a different thing you’re still not allowed to sell it<br>which is fine like people fucking grow it you know really<br>fucking hunter s thompson had it right<br>hunter s thompson when he was running for sheriff<br>he was saying that no drug<br>good enough to be taken should be allowed to be sold<br>that was like a law that he was going to pass an aspen<br>and he was going to call aspen fat city<br>he was going to change the name of aspen to fat city<br>he was going to tear up all the roads<br>and sod the streets so there was all dirt roads everywhere<br>he fucking<br>lost by four hundred votes it’s only four hundred votes<br>if he won if he was<br>the sheriff of aspen that would have been fucking bad ass<br>but one of the things that he wanted to have was that<br>any drug that<br>you can take that is good enough to be taken it should be legal<br>and he’s fucking totally right<br>you know if people want weed<br>it should be<br>people should trade things for weed or you know what fuck it<br>you should be able to buy it if you want to<br>but the problem with that is<br>you know then you’re gonna get some<br>really unscrupulous people that just want to sell pot<br>you know they just want to sell it<br>and they<br>didn’t want to make profit off of it and then it becomes<br>like anything else<br>they try to cut out the competition<br>like one of the weed stores<br>that i go to there’s a guy right next door to them<br>opened up like i’m talking like right next door<br>like there’s maybe like one storefront between<br>two wheat stores<br>and the guys pissed off and he’s fucking this guy’s a dick<br>that’s totally not in the spirit of<br>you know what marijuana is supposed to be<br>i mean you’re not supposed to be opening up right next to<br>stordo dude until his competition<br>but he shouldn’t be like fuck that dude<br>you know what’s that dude doing<br>he’s just another dude selling weed<br>yeah i shouldn’t be doing it right next to you yes correct but<br>don’t be an asshole<br>you’re fucking selling weed pal<br>you know<br>you ain’t fixing the world<br>hunterist thompson is my hero and i’m planning full sleeves<br>of ralph steedman art are you really wow<br>that’s a fucking good idea<br>steadman<br>steadman or steedman i forget i say his name is his steedman<br>fucking i love his art his arts perfectly goes like<br>what’s the word i’m looking for compliments<br>hunter s thompson’s writing you know that guy<br>just<br>fucking nailed it from the very first time they worked together<br>when they did that<br>the kentucky derby is decadent and depraved from that story<br>all the way on to fear and loathing in las vegas that<br>ralph guy he fucking nailed it<br>he was hanging with hunter he totally got the vibe that<br>hunter was writing<br>he totally got where hunter was seeing things<br>you know<br>i just started getting into hunter as thompson really recently<br>i was i guess maybe a year and a half ago i was<br>staying in a hotel room in seattle<br>and i ordered up ganzo on<br>the paper view in the hotel<br>just because that nothing else looked good<br>said fuck it i’ll just check this out and<br>immediately became a hunterist thompson fan<br>start reading his books and<br>i’m reading the one i’m reading out<br>the one i’m reading now is this one great shark hunt<br>it’s great it’s got everything in there it’s got<br>a bunch of his different shit<br>fear and loadings in there<br>the kentucky derbies in there<br>a lot a lot of great stores like a collection of his works<br>the quintessential<br>well it’s need to open grow homes with retail fronts yeah<br>man keep it all easy that’s what i’m talking about<br>if you never been to a grow room before<br>i’ve only been to one grow room<br>it was pretty interesting there was<br>a place in la<br>where<br>it was a full service place you can get a prescription there<br>you could get weed there and you could<br>they could get weed there and they grew it<br>so there was like this<br>back room where they had all these lights set up<br>it was pretty fucking trippy man<br>like it was a big ass room<br>and it was filled with these plants and they were all lit up<br>and you walked through the plants and<br>like yeah they were alive<br>you know they’re living plants but it felt like<br>like they were conscious like maybe it was because i was really<br>high<br>that might be but<br>maybe because i was really high i was able to tune into it<br>but it was it was a very<br>weird sensation<br>it felt like i was around<br>like living entities<br>like it didn’t just<br>feel like they were plants it felt like they were alive<br>you know it was very strange it’s cool<br>i thought about<br>i was like<br>that’d be cool to have something like that in my house<br>but that’s pretty illegal<br>federally at least<br>you know<br>if they caught you with a bunch of plants in your house<br>you know they’d be like hey<br>bitch what are you doing with those<br>you’re allowed to have a bunch<br>you can have like up to six plants<br>you actually allowed that more<br>because you have that x special oh<br>that’s right i have an exemption<br>because i’m a fucking real stoner<br>is two of these fucking with us here<br>now but you can totally turn off that second one this one yeah<br>sorry folks getting organized this is the first time<br>i’m always threatening to do some shit like this and i never<br>fall through<br>why were the ufc ring girls fired<br>i do not know they were very nice<br>all of them were two girls were fired they left ariani who was<br>very nice person as well<br>i’ve been friends with her for years she’s super cool chick<br>and hot very hot<br>probably<br>classically beautiful like it doesn’t get any more beautiful<br>her face very nice person<br>too you can follow her on twitter she’s on the twitter<br>she’s the one with the fake wig still working<br>why’d you talk about fake wig<br>how dare you first of all how dare you<br>how dare you fuck with her whole

i thought they land a housewives thing<br>you know how that wigs are back<br>so i thought that was one of those<br>you might be right<br>you might be right<br>in land<br>you ever watched that housewives with land show oh<br>there’s nothing like first of all<br>there’s nothing like white girls<br>around black girls when they start talking black<br>i love that shit<br>i love when white guys do it<br>i love when white girls do it to me it’s just like watching<br>chimps at the zoo when they fuck each other when they go crazy<br>it’s like wow<br>this is weird it’s interesting<br>when white people around black people they start acting black<br>there’s no better example than the stephens of gall show<br>holy shit if you see what he does that<br>he pulls up to a group of black people’s like what up<br>cause what’s going on oh<br>dude much love much love he talks black<br>like really condescendingly<br>and then you know when he’s in the car when the camera’s on<br>he’ll talk like buddhist<br>says it says like stupid shit you know<br>the the one monk was walking with the younger monk<br>and the younger monk says<br>what is the way of buddha<br>and so the older monk throws him in the water deep<br>he talks it like<br>he’s two totally different dudes he talks like the<br>steven cigar who’s like the mystical man<br>and the steven cigar<br>who is this fucking strange cop in louisiana he has a<br>southern accent that he uses part of the time part of the time<br>and then occasionally he drops the southern accent<br>and he goes with a full on black<br>accent like way he’s in the hood<br>but steven cigar is a fucking cop like for real<br>like he puts on a bulletproof vest<br>he gets in his fucking car and they go fight crime<br>and it’s like who is letting him do this<br>like how crazy<br>is it that all you have to have is a cup of fucking movies<br>have you seen his website<br>oh it’s genius yeah it’s awesome<br>is it stephensugal com<br>i think so i’ve seen jim can you see jim kerry’s website yeah<br>jim kerry has the most amazing website in the whole entire room<br>it’s a pretty cool<br>i’ve never seen a better website yeah it’s very very unique but<br>when i see websites like that<br>i wish i still tripped on shrooms all the time<br>because i would just sit in his website on yeah<br>no shit<br>beyond the mine’s eye<br>yeah the ciccles show is fuck<br>oh what the fuck oh<br>we’re gonna attacked<br>this behind me this sign<br>is a point of controversy from the mansion when i hosted<br>the i know is terrible<br>listen we thought it was terrible too<br>we got we got fucked<br>when we<br>when doug stan hope and i want to do that show they lie to us<br>they told us you can do nudity<br>we’ll blur it out<br>you can swear<br>we’ll beep it out we want you to go crazy we want to get sued<br>it’s gonna be great publicity<br>and then when we started doing it<br>first of all<br>janet jackson pulled her nipple out and everybody went<br>fucking crazy shit crazy<br>we’re still feeling the effects from that it’s amazing<br>like literally television got set back<br>a decade because of janet jackson’s nipple<br>and the big thing<br>was that they were showing it during the dinner hour<br>and children were watching well<br>isn’t like a woman’s nipple are we that fucking crazy<br>it’s not like she had a rifle up or pussy it’s a fucking nipple<br>you know that’s where baby’s feed it’s<br>is it that offensive that’s for babies<br>it is mass i mean talking about it<br>being during the dinner hour<br>somebody had a really good point when this happened like<br>he said isn’t that like the first meal<br>that’s like the dinner yeah i mean it’s breast<br>yeah you see that winning since you were a kid well<br>ever you know what especially having kids on my own now<br>when i see<br>mrs rogan make fucking milk with her tits and i’m like i see<br>the tits are dead to me i don’t suck on them anymore<br>but what’s more important<br>is that you look at them and you say that’s like<br>those are<br>that’s like where food comes from like it’s not offensive<br>but anyway this thing behind us make me hard<br>this is how fucking stupid they were<br>when we were doing this show<br>there was an argument<br>and we hit we came up<br>with a game show called make you make me hard<br>and what it was is the guy would be strapped into a chair<br>and he would have his box on his dick and with a<br>light would go off on the box<br>and you know the light would indicate that he has a boner<br>and so we’d have like midgets<br>eaten bananas and shit and oh<br>he’s getting hard you know<br>it was kind of coin<br>but what we really the reason why we did it is<br>one of the gags was we had this really hot chick<br>and she climbs all over him the audience is going<br>fucking crazy they’re going nuts<br>and this really hot chick<br>at the end of this he pulls her tits out<br>he’s sucking under tits<br>whipped cream the whole deal<br>and then she pulls her panties off and she’s got a dick<br>and the audience goes crazy she was a tranny<br>and i mean i’ve never heard a bigger wave of disappointment<br>that when this<br>this tranny pulls out<br>this dick and she was taking all kinds of hormones<br>so it was like a dick that had been poisoned<br>it looked like dead it was like like dark<br>it was dark and shriveled up like it burned like chemically<br>burned like it was like a<br>little dead monkey dick when i smell it<br>and she pulled it out<br>and she starts like swinging it around<br>and the fucking audience went crazy and<br>the guy sitting in the chair<br>just had this look in his face of heart well<br>they approved all that<br>but what they wouldn’t approve is the name of the show<br>make me hard<br>they said that we had a name of the show make me stiff<br>like this is like an argument<br>like for real like there’s a difference like<br>they mean the same thing just make me stiff doesn’t sound<br>doesn’t sound quite as funny<br>really doesn’t matter i mean what’s the difference<br>but the point<br>was that they were willing to argue this that was a big<br>deal for them<br>and that shows you how these shows work<br>the best shows like<br>like stand up comedian so if you take a guy like dave<br>chapelle or you know cat williams or anybody any<br>good comic that you like<br>they write all their own shit<br>they write it<br>they perform they’re saying shit that they think is funny<br>they are the producer<br>they are the performer<br>they’re the whole ball of wax they’re the writer<br>they’re everything<br>and that’s why you get a pure product<br>because you get a product that’s from this dude’s mind well<br>what happens is when you like start working on a television show<br>these people that are working for the network<br>somebody has to work for the network<br>and you would assume that the people<br>at the very top of the food chain<br>are the perfect people for the job<br>but that’s not true<br>they’re just people that somehow never got that fucking job<br>and a lot of them they like to think that they know what’s good<br>they like to think they have an eye for and they always<br>want to put their footprint on it<br>they want to put their hand print on it they want to change<br>something<br>anything that<br>i think the background should be blue we’re gonna<br>ruin the whole show with this red background<br>and they’ll go crazy and they’ll fucking fight over this why<br>because they want to be the one to say well<br>it was me that decided for the blue background if<br>they didn’t go with that blue background<br>the show was shit am i right<br>and then the wife will agree with them<br>and they all get fucking pilled up together<br>this is what they argued over make me hard so this is<br>i got to keep this sign<br>because it was useless<br>because we had to change the sign to make me stiff<br>like it’s okay to pull out your fucking dick<br>it’s okay to have a guy strap to a chair<br>thinking a chick is on top of them<br>and this chick pulls out this wrinkled poison black dick<br>that’s okay but you can’t call it hard you have to call it stiff<br>it’s really that dumb it seems like i would be exaggerating but<br>that’s why dave chipel walked away from the shepel show<br>it’s just because<br>having when you’re a comic<br>having somebody else tell you what’s good and what’s bad<br>like there was one of the things we did in<br>the man show where we wanted joey diez<br>if you don’t know what joey diez is<br>his twitter is mad flavor<br>one word<br>at mad flavor<br>and joey diez is<br>one of the funniest dudes i’ve ever met in my life<br>he’s like one of the funniest human beings to ever live<br>and joey was<br>like three hundred fifty pounds he’s down to three hundred<br>but back then he was like three hundred fifty<br>and he would always get naked we get naked all the time<br>get naked on stage<br>and his balls literally<br>look like grapefruit in an old lady’s pannyos<br>i mean they’re fucking ridiculous<br>and he doesn’t shave them<br>but they have no hair on them<br>like he has no hair on his arms<br>no hair on his chest<br>and he’s fat as fuck<br>and we wanted to have him<br>introduce us to the beginning of his show<br>he kicks open this door<br>and comes out yelling let’s get this party started<br>and his balls are jingling and it’s fucking hilarious<br>first of all hilarious he’s joey’s hilarious<br>no matter what he could read doug stand<br>hopes that joey ds could read the phone book<br>and it’d be finer than most of the shit<br>you see on late night tv<br>and that’s toll true<br>but they were like that’s not funny what’s funny about this<br>this is not funny<br>no one’s gonna lie it was like a big argument<br>and i said listen let’s do two openings<br>we’ll do one regular opening<br>and then we’ll do one opening with joey well<br>we did the opening with joey and they went fucking crazy<br>of course everybody was screaming and laughing and young<br>and it said the tone<br>the tone that we wanted to have like this is<br>we’re just trying to have fun<br>we’re not you know we’re not trying to be relevant<br>or we’re just trying to have something<br>that people enjoy let’s have fun let’s have a fucking good time<br>but it was almost impossible to try to have that good time<br>when you have<br>you know other people like<br>that aren’t necessarily funny at all<br>and they’re like putting their input into what’s<br>what should be in this comedy show<br>so doug and i got fucked but<br>the most important thing is that we had a good time<br>and we came well<br>we were always good friends but we came great friends doing it<br>all right what else what’s going on here<br>the snowflakes what you don’t like the snowflakes<br>they’re dragging the video stream down oh<br>you know what you might be right dude<br>the snowflakes might be fucking us<br>freedom<br>no more snowflakes is that better everybody oh<br>sure it’s better my fucking my internet’s gay<br>you need to upgrade that i can’t believe you

numbers and<br>he could fuck all these girls like he’s not even paying these<br>girls it’s incredible<br>because one of the girls was like asking for money<br>and he’s like i can’t help you<br>like

show that was just like<br>because i didn’t<br>didn’t really<br>do much acting before that i<br>acted on one other sitcom that i got from doing stand up comedy<br>and<br>in nineteen ninety four i’d only been doing comedy six years<br>so it’s like i was still pretty raw as a comedian<br>and also that i’m on this fucking tv show i was like whoa<br>and then i’m on the show<br>not only i’m on a tv show i’m on a tv show with phil hartman<br>and i was like<br>this is fucking nuts<br>you know and dave foley and andy deck i mean this is<br>a pretty incredible<br>job but fear fact it was just about game<br>please getting that paper<br>you know saying shit i know that paper<br>just like king moses get that paper<br>brittany murphy thoughts<br>you know what<br>i mean<br>i don’t have any thoughts until i find out what killed her<br>you know i mean<br>everybody says that it’s drugs i don’t know if it was drugs<br>i don’t think<br>the husband doesn’t want to have an autopsy<br>kind of strange you know<br>really strange you know<br>especially since obviously<br>there we’re gonna do one<br>anyways because it’s kind of like why did she die<br>yeah unless you kill her i mean<br>why doesn’t that guy want an autopsy if it was a murder case<br>then of course<br>he would want an autopsy right<br>you’d be like how do you<br>dive natural the only time way<br>you dive natural causes on you thirty two years old<br>is if you have like a serious health condition or<br>if you take something that kills you which is pretty natural<br>i’ve read that a lot of her close friends<br>stopped hanging out with her when she got<br>married to that guy because<br>of him so there’s something with this guy well<br>i’ve had some friends that have had some serious<br>drug problems in the past i had a friend that died from drugs<br>my best friend when i lived in new york<br>and he used to do heroin he used to do crack but mostly heroin<br>and he had like manageable problems with<br>coke and stuff like that<br>until you got on heroin and heroin just fucking<br>sealed his fate that shit that shit just gets in your blood<br>it becomes a part of you<br>i mean i’ve seen people<br>jones and for coke i’ve seen people jones for a lot of shit<br>but there’s something<br>really weird about watching people jones for heroin<br>i mean it’s it’s like they need water<br>like they’re in the desert and they need water<br>and when people get involved in this and apparently<br>that’s what a lot of<br>the hollywood<br>kids are doing a lot of them are doing fucking heroin<br>you know i don’t know what it’s all about<br>but it’s pretty spooky man<br>real alcoholics are pretty spooky too like when you wake up<br>and you’re not the first thing you drink is a beer<br>yeah<br>i’ve met a lot of alcoholics<br>i know a lot of alcoholics<br>i know a lot of functioning alcoholics<br>and i know a lot of people<br>that are just<br>you know just flat out drunks<br>especially comics you know<br>i’ve done a lot of comics that have had real alcohol problems<br>because they get free<br>booze and they’re out in clubs every night<br>and you know<br>alcohol gives you a liquid courage<br>and if you’re performing every night<br>you might be drinking every night or you’re drinking every night<br>you’re gonna have a fucking problem<br>eventually that shit’s gonna grab you<br>conspiracy theories are only theories until proven fact<br>yeah all<br>they they’re at real conspiracies<br>most conspiracy theories are stupid because people want to find<br>the mystery shit<br>they want to find bigfoot you know when meanwhile<br>there’s a bunch of real live animals<br>that are way more interesting than bigfoot<br>if bigfoot if we found bigfoot<br>the bigfoot would be in a fucking cage<br>right next to the monkeys at the zoo<br>if we found them if we really caught them<br>they would be like look<br>there’s a big ape<br>you know we got the short ape there’s a big ten foot tall ape<br>nobody would give a shit<br>but like killer whales if killer whales didn’t exist<br>and there was<br>some animal that people<br>talked about in legend that was as smart as people lived<br>in the ocean but breathed air<br>and had to come up for air<br>and doesn’t eat human being saves human beings<br>but kills everything else including great white sharks<br>a super intelligent being<br>that’s gigantic and murderous and runs the ocean<br>people would say fuck that that’s crazy that’s not real<br>that can’t be real<br>but it is real<br>we just know it’s real<br>and because the fact that we know it’s real<br>it’s not as interesting to people<br>people love mysteries we love discovering new shit<br>like the lockness monster<br>lockness monster doesn’t do shit<br>it doesn’t kill anybody it doesn’t do anything<br>every now that pokes its head out of the water and it was like<br>whoa i saw it everybody gets crazy<br>you know meanwhile<br>there’s fucking crocodiles that are real they’re alive<br>they’re gigantic they’re like fucking thirty feet long<br>they can hold their breath underwater for like hours at a time<br>they don’t have to eat for a year<br>i mean crocodiles are fucking crazy<br>they’re literally dinosaurs that are still alive today<br>they were the exact same ways they are now<br>hundreds of millions of years ago<br>nobody gives a fuck everybody’s looking for the logness monster<br>you know there’s something that people<br>really really get into<br>when it comes to conspiracies<br>you know and i’ve been guilty of it myself you know<br>like i used to really be into ufos and<br>all kinds of stuff like that until i kind of realized like<br>what i’m into is the unknown<br>what i’m into<br>is like somehow another is if there’s something that’s unknown<br>and i figured out and i find it and i know it’s proven and true<br>then somehow another you gain something from that<br>i guess you do to a certain extent if you can really prove it<br>but<br>mostly what it is is this weird desire that human beings have<br>for things to prove things<br>so it’s a very weird thing<br>conspiracy theory is like everybody’s always looking like for<br>all sorts of conspiracies that aren’t real<br>i know this also from<br>working where i’ve had people<br>like working with the usc<br>like people are always talking about the usc wants this<br>and joe rogan said that because the usc told them saying<br>the usc never tells me to say shit<br>they don’t they literally never<br>tell me what to say my job’s the craziest job ever<br>i’m just literally the guy who speaks for this<br>multi hundred million dollar sports company<br>and nobody tells me what to do<br>i show up and they tell me what the fights are<br>and i just do it i try to be professional as possible<br>i try not to swear occasionally you know it’ll slip up<br>with that but i’m trying not to swear<br>but all i’m trying to do is do commentary in the fights<br>the only thing they’ve ever told me what to do is<br>when they were trying to buy pride<br>and pride fucked them over<br>and there’s this big thing going on back and forth they said<br>don’t please<br>don’t mention pride by name you can mention all the fighters<br>but don’t mention pride by name<br>because they didn’t want to give<br>advertisement to that organization<br>which totally is<br>totally legitimate totally makes sense to me you know<br>but they don’t tell me like hype this guy up talk about that guy<br>don’t mention this guy’s name<br>and make sure you tell everybody<br>this guy this is the guy we want to win<br>there’s none of that there’s none of that zero so<br>i know that’s a conspiracy that people think is real<br>that’s not real i know<br>i know there’s a lot of other ones that people think is real<br>but there’s ones that are real<br>you know cam chaos are the ones that i’ve recently turned on yes<br>that whole thing you talked about the you know<br>yeah the hair yeah<br>there’s a lot of people<br>that would look at those things in the sky and go<br>what is that what are they doing well<br>i talked to a pilot<br>and i asked a pilot about it<br>and he gave me a very simple explanation<br>about how water<br>going through those jets<br>those jet engines at a certain altitude with certain<br>you know weather conditions<br>certain moisture all they have like humidity amidity<br>because baremetric pressure there’s all sorts of factors<br>but if it’s the right factors<br>there’s enough<br>enough water in it<br>it’ll create clouds like literally jets create clouds<br>so all these people like man they’re making clouds look<br>that’s what happens when jets flies through the fucking air<br>like the idea that they would be explained cities<br>poisoning people it’s like<br>don’t they live on the ground too<br>right they’re spraying themselves<br>spraying their families and stuff what do they have shots<br>they’re taking shots that they don’t get<br>they don’t experiment with weather but<br>the majority of the lines you see in the air definitely<br>there’s legitimate concerns about like that harp program<br>or they’re fucking<br>doing things to the ionosphere and you know<br>there’s for sure<br>they’re experimenting with weather<br>because we know that china has a successfully created rain<br>you know they’ve done successful weather operations so<br>there’s there are<br>absolutely real conspiracies<br>but there’s a lot of goofy ones man<br>and the problem is it’s very difficult for people<br>to once they made a decision about one something<br>like jfk you know oswald acted alone<br>and people just get that in their head oswald acted alone<br>it’s very difficult for them to look at contrary evidence<br>and take it into consideration<br>like it’s almost like there’s a competition going on they want<br>their side to be right<br>and people have a real hard time and our friend<br>that we were talking about<br>the chemtrails<br>didn’t want it but like we’re having an argument with him<br>while saying listen man<br>you don’t<br>know like you say well the research that i’ve done i’m like<br>you’re watching youtube clips is that what<br>constitutes research these days<br>you know<br>and he was like convinced that kem trails are real and i’m like<br>they make no sense and the other thing the pilot had that<br>was a good point was like he’s a pilot he’s like<br>believe me man pilates would be talking about it right<br>it wouldn’t be like something<br>that’s that easy you could just hire a god a fucking spray<br>every city in the world<br>every day of the week and they’re gonna keep their mouth shut<br>plus<br>all these reporters that are like getting pissed off at like<br>oil businesses for ripping off customers<br>what if that you were getting sprayed with poison<br>wouldn’t that reporter be crazy yeah<br>it researched reporter you know<br>it’s silly that’s i think chemtrails are a silly one<br>not to say they haven’t sprayed people before<br>not to say that<br>there haven’t been<br>some experiments where they’ve sprayed you know<br>certain bacteria or certain colds<br>you know over an area to see if they can get people sick well<br>why not<br>we know there’s a thing called operation midnight climax<br>that in the nineteen fifties<br>the cia ran fucking brothels<br>they ran hourhouses in new york<br>in san francisco and they ran these things<br>and what they did was<br>they ran the hourhouse so they can do lsd experiments on people<br>and so they unknowingly<br>gave these john’s acid<br>so these poor guys would go in there just to try to<br>give their you know<br>their hard earned money you know they probably<br>you know didn’t even have much paid just<br>whatever they had to get their dick sucked<br>and they’re getting dosed with acid<br>freaking the fuck out probably already feeling super guilty<br>probably half of them were married<br>and they just cheat otherwise<br>and they felt guilty about that<br>and then they’re dosed up with acid and<br>dealing with the reality of the situation<br>we know the cia did that this is<br>information that was released and the freedom information<br>act you look it up google it’s pretty interesting<br>it’s called operation midnight climax<br>and it’s just one of<br>many experiments that the cia did<br>unknowingly on american citizens taxpayers<br>and they’ve done it forever<br>and that’s how they do business<br>and guaranteed that if they did this back in nineteen fifty<br>they’re doing something like it now<br>it’s not like they changed it’s not like<br>these all these like conspiracies<br>all these things that the government’s done like<br>operation northwoods<br>operation northwards<br>was the thing that they proposed in the nineteen sixties<br>nineteen sixty two and this was<br>signed by the joint chiefs of staff and then vetoed by kennedy<br>and what it was was they were trying to get people<br>enthusiastic about a war against cuba so<br>they were planning on blowing up american ships<br>like real ships they were going to have<br>mock plane crashes<br>where they were going to blow up drones in the air<br>and they were going to blame it on the cubans<br>then we were going to say that all these people<br>died and they were going to take<br>the passengers and<br>put them under<br>false aliases and have pilots under false aliases and<br>that pilot was gonna give maydays and say he got shot down<br>look that up to it’s really interesting it’s called operation<br>northwoods and this was a real<br>plan that they had drafted in the nineteen sixties that<br>the department of defense drafted up<br>and the joint chiefsis half signed and kennedy vetoed it<br>and kenny was like you guys are fucking crazy like what<br>are you doing<br>like you’re gonna fake attacks in order to get people<br>to want to go to war with cuba and that’s<br>probably one of the reasons why they kill kennedy<br>you know who knows but<br>these are real conspiracies they’re real we know that<br>things are conspired on<br>the real problem<br>with conspiracies is nobody wants to look stupid<br>and when you say that<br>you believe something like you believe an alien abduction<br>or you believe<br>the government killed kennedy or you believe you know anything<br>nutty we didn’t land on the moon<br>when you say you don’t believe nutty things<br>people just automatically<br>label you a kook instead of looking at it and going okay<br>what has the government done they really have dosed<br>people with lsd<br>with other knowledge they really set up hour houses<br>the government<br>the cia did this<br>really they really<br>were faking attack they were planning on faking attacks<br>on american civilians<br>and blowing up american<br>ships and blaming on the cubans they really were gonna<br>attack guantanamo bay<br>attack soldiers<br>they were gonna fucking shoot mortars into guantanamo bay<br>you’re going to kill american soldiers<br>and blame it on the cubans<br>and get us to attack them that’s all real<br>so you gotta keep your eyes open<br>you gotta keep your mind open<br>and the problem with conspiracy theories is<br>people choose one side or the other<br>you know there’s a conspiracy or ridiculous<br>and i’m not believing this<br>or they go well<br>you know they are the conspiracies are real<br>and it’s usually not<br>that black or white it usually takes a lot of looking at<br>before you get to the real truth<br>and and the real truth is fucking sketchy<br>i mean<br>it’s real hard to have information<br>about a lot of things in this world<br>as much information as we have on the internet<br>there’s still a lot of shit<br>that you don’t get like bill mark twittered something today<br>that i was like this guy isn’t even<br>he’s incorrectly this has all been disproven<br>he twittered something<br>an anti christian thing<br>about mithra<br>and you know it’s like how fun<br>he says bill mars is even doing his research<br>like he’s twittering something that<br>everybody says<br>about mythra but it was disproven he gets his news by the paper<br>here it is mythra born twelve twenty five twelve disciples<br>died rose on mate on the third day<br>perform miracles known as a lamb<br>the way<br>the truth the light six hundred years before jesus christ<br>i see what his point is<br>his point is what he’s trying to say it’s like hey<br>there was no you<br>know there was no jesus christ this this<br>fable this myth has existed in many different forms<br>but the myth thing is totally wrong<br>because the myth thing if you just google<br>zeitgeist the movie debunked this guy gets really into<br>the mythology behind<br>you know in zeitgeist they talk about how jesus<br>really is basically the same<br>story as all these different stories before<br>and one of them was mythra and you know so<br>so bilmarre quoting on his thing that<br>mither was born twelve twenty five had twelve disciples well<br>if you go to this other site that this guy<br>seems like a really intelligent guy i don’t know if he’s right<br>but he’s talking about anybody’s researched at least<br>talking about the miss and the ledges of mythra are numerous<br>numerous in account and spans several different cultures<br>he says i ran into a brick wall of sorts trying to track down<br>any of this information<br>i cannot find any evidence<br>of his birthday being december<br>twenty fifth the only dates to correspond to him<br>are his festival on october eighth and another<br>on september twelve through sixteenth<br>a cattle pairing festival october twelve through sixteenth<br>there’s absolutely this important part<br>there’s absolutely no evidence anywhere<br>that he had twelve disciples or twelve of anything<br>for that matter no<br>mithras scholars seem to know about it<br>he was not born to a virgin<br>but rather out of solid rock<br>so i mean it’s it’s really<br>really interesting people like you know<br>there’s not there’s not enough research of information<br>people don’t really look these things up<br>they quote a little bit of something<br>they saw on the internet<br>and that’s the problem is there’s no there’s no way<br>you can have access to everything<br>there’s no way you can know about everything<br>it’s impossible<br>so there’s going to be a lot of shit<br>that you’re talking about you form<br>an opinion on<br>when you’re really just talking out of your ass<br>and that’s<br>where most people are when it comes to conspiracy theories<br>you know everything with everything<br>people talk either ass and because people have a<br>huge vested interest in being correct about things<br>you know people<br>hate being foolish the hate being the dumb one<br>the hate being uninformed<br>you know people love correcting people<br>they love like your is<br>you apostrophe r e as in you are you know okay<br>you’re a fucking awesome dude because you spotted that guy me<br>while i’ll do that all the time<br>that’s kind of why i like the iphone how it always<br>fucks up my texting and stuff like that<br>because then<br>people are starting to slowly less do it to me now because<br>everyone’s doing it<br>conspiracy theory with jesse ventura i haven’t seen it<br>i haven’t even brian didn’t like it it was alright<br>i don’t know jesse ventura is one of those dudes he thinks<br>because he’s a navy seal<br>or he’s a former navy seal<br>that he has inside information<br>i’m a former neighbor thrill<br>that opian anthony thing just really got to me on both sides<br>yeah you were upset at jim norton well<br>i was on both sides<br>that got me upset i thought they both handled<br>it it’s hard having a fucking intelligent conversation<br>seven o’clock in the morning got down<br>you know<br>whenever i do those morning radio shows i’m always like<br>like what am i even talking about like most half out of it<br>mumbling shit<br>it’s hard to wake the fuck up it’s like<br>you have to drink coffee if you’re gonna do<br>one of those morning radio shows<br>you really can’t go in sober<br>you gotta have<br>a little bit of that in a cup of coffee<br>mothra or rodan<br>i was more of a rodan<br>fan i thought mothra was kind of a faggy monster<br>big stupid moth that’s a dumbass<br>yeah i mean<br>why don’t i have a giant roach people like<br>roach as roaches are scary as fuck<br>why do you want to have a big stupid moth<br>you don’t the japanese had a bunch of crazy ass monsters<br>they still do they still do those<br>gods you know<br>they still turtle remember that turtle god says is that rodan<br>rodan to turtle yeah yeah<br>rodan’s a turtle<br>come on man the fucking turtle yeah<br>you know they still do the godzilla movies with the people<br>in the costume<br>i heard they still make them in japan<br>we have no confirmation<br>see this is another<br>another thing that we’re talking out of our ass<br>we don’t really have we’ve done no research you know<br>sick isn’t that what that means what’s a sick<br>what happens to the ice man<br>now you know i don’t know man i don’t know<br>is if i type on this is this gonna go to my twitter<br>ahan’s gonna twit okay<br>so how do i tell people to follow us on this thing<br>seat you can

at four<br>yeah i’m at that hide at all not very high<br>there’s two hundred thirty you motherfuckers in here right now<br>we’re rolling strong bitches<br>two hundred thirty merry christmas<br>merry christmas to all of you<br>all right what else you might have a fan of gi kundo<br>i’m a fan of bruce lee i’m a fan of his idea<br>his idea to add all the mart i mean he was really<br>the original mixed martial artist<br>when i started out as a kid<br>i did karate and then i started doing taikwando<br>and each one of those<br>disciplines karate and taikwando wanted you to think that<br>their style was the best style the end all be all style karate<br>they didn’t want you training with taekwondo people<br>taekwondo people<br>they didn’t want you training with karate people<br>you know<br>judo people didn’t want you training with kung fu people<br>it was like everybody was like really attached to their style<br>so really<br>bruce lee and jekundo that’s the original mixed martial art<br>that’s the original guy to look at you know<br>all the different systems and take what’s useful about<br>from each one i mean bruce lee was a<br>he was a genius when it came to martial arts way<br>way way ahead of his time<br>i like this because the questions are slower and twitters yeah<br>this is pretty cool<br>this is the first time i’ve done this<br>like i said i’m always threatening to do this<br>but we’re doing it now<br>you motherfuckers<br>subverter talk more about hunter s thompson<br>i love that feeling where the truth just hits you<br>hunters thompson was a fucking genius<br>he was one of the very few dudes that really captured<br>the anxt of the sixties and the seventies<br>the nixon era and you know that<br>he was a part of the acid culture of the sixties<br>he was a part of the culture like<br>the san francisco hate ashbury movement where it’s like<br>everybody was doing acid all these people were like a good acid<br>so all these people were like really coming together<br>and they were really releasing their egos and their self<br>identity and kind of like<br>losing themselves in a movement and then<br>this hippy movement of the sixties<br>which seems like really stupid now<br>we look at it and it’s like god<br>look at these idiots of their long hair<br>and their stupid clothes<br>but what they were doing was they were<br>they were radically departing from the previous culture<br>i mean the difference between the fifties<br>and the sixties is fucking gigantic<br>the difference between like buddy holly and<br>jimmy hendrix is like<br>you know i mean that’s that’s another world<br>i mean that’s not like a ten year evolution<br>that’s an evolution that would have taken hundreds<br>or not maybe not even gotten there at all<br>it’s almost like<br>you they needed the drugs<br>they needed acid and mushrooms and pot<br>and payote they needed all that shit and heroin<br>to launch themselves like from one<br>one frequency<br>to the next one<br>and the sixties were a totally different frequency<br>when it came to music<br>when it came to culture<br>and that<br>set the stage<br>for what happened the seventies and the eighties<br>and with a really crappy music that came from<br>the the eighties and<br>some of them in the seventies but definitely the eighties like<br>what that is<br>is like this consciousness this incredible music where<br>these people were like really like tuning into the art of it<br>in the sixties like<br>more sixties music is like classic fucking shit<br>you know that you<br>you here today and you go god damn that’s a good song it’s like<br>they they really figured out how to tap into the real shit<br>know the real energy that makes<br>that makes art interesting that makes art resonate<br>and i think they did it with drugs and i think that<br>the decline in the seventies and certainly in the eighties<br>was because there was like a void left where the this this this<br>tuning in this connection to the real pure source was gone<br>you know it’s like whatever they had hit whatever frequency<br>they had nailed in the sixties<br>the echoes of it had died down by the time to eighties head<br>you know i think<br>hunter as thompson had a fucking brilliant<br>story that he wrote a brilliant like<br>piece that he wrote<br>the wave the talking about how the sixties is like<br>was like like a wave and that<br>when the the sixties ended<br>you could see where the wave broke back like we’re<br>they thought that people<br>could be like where they saw the true potential of<br>humanity of the united states of<br>the human race in general<br>and he saw just roll back and go back to where it was<br>and that’s what it was<br>between the sixties and the symphonies you know<br>and he nailed that shit better than anybody<br>hunter s thompson’s words today<br>still when you look at like<br>especially what’s going on with the bush administration<br>and what was just like<br>the clearest evidence ever of<br>massive amounts of corruption and government where you know<br>it’s i mean<br>they they got us into a war that made no fucking sense i mean<br>and it was obvious like across the board the internet was<br>you know up the information was being<br>you know very easily transferred back and forth<br>and yet it still managed to go through<br>and<br>the way he felt about the nixon administration<br>i mean you literally could substitute nixon for bush<br>and then insert most of the shit that he said<br>into you know<br>there are only two thousands<br>raw sound does it sound shitty<br>what do you think about doing a radio show of my own<br>i would love to do a radio show<br>the only problem is i don’t think anybody wants to pay me<br>to do a radio show<br>i might have to do a radio show like this<br>because<br>right now i mean<br>adam corolla has a sweet setup where he does<br>podcast and he gets a lot of people to listen to it<br>and that might be a way to go because<br>satellite radio is struggling financially and<br>you know some people make money from it like<br>you know obviously howard stern makes a lot of money from it<br>and i think obey anthony make good money from it but<br>they don’t want to pay anybody else they’re not making<br>money so they don’t have the money to give out<br>so i think if i’m

yeah<br>you would love it when i<br>first started out<br>when i was i was a kid<br>i was really into comic books i wanted to be a comic book artist<br>big bad wolf three<br>oh cool you already scanned it yeah scanned it<br>upload a tweet photo it’s uploading<br>when i was uh this my fuck everything up my gang it’s service<br>it’s so slow<br>yeah look how slow this is because this is a big ass

yeah<br>too many people chats that shit ain’t<br>that shit ain’t gonna work<br>tracy lee just sent me a text message<br>you guys know tracy lee<br>from<br>dana was in the chat you missed it oh<br>dana was in the chat how’s dana<br>i don’t know that’s not a real dana she thinks it’s a real dana<br>why do you think it’s a real dana<br>how dare you be dumb<br>how dare you welcome to the internet<br>can you my cheeseburger you know what<br>can i have cheeseburger dennis<br>got no fucking time to be my goddamn chat<br>prince say you’re a bomb<br>em i’m in the chat all right tracy i got you right here tracy<br>i’m in the chat too<br>the<br>chat<br>too and that wasn’t dana you dumb bitch<br>is tracy lee she’s the combat lifestyle photographer yeah<br>this is the best phone of all time<br>the iphone ladies and gentlemen<br>you really can’t fuck with it we’ve tried every other phone<br>i’m a technical fucking geek i’m a nerd i love phones<br>but there’s no phone that can fuck with the iphone there’s no<br>network that can fuck with varizon though<br>and that’s the real goddamn problem<br>so i don’t use the iphone as my main phone<br>i mostly use the iphone these days as like an internet<br>device i use it as like a little ten<br>mini laptop and shit<br>but for my phone<br>i use one of these blackberry storm twos<br>which as a phone is not nearly as good<br>it’s kind of funky<br>the typing on it’s not bad the storm<br>two is definitely better than the storm one<br>but man fucking<br>the network it’s a hundred times better<br>the varizon network<br>when i had at amp t like when i would drive to jujitsu at night<br>i drive the same way<br>and i gotta go through hollywood and my shit would drop out<br>three times on the way<br>to hollywood<br>three fucking times in twenty five thirty miles whatever<br>it is three times the shit would drop out with verizon<br>straight through never drops out doesn’t drop out anywhere<br>i get better reception inside buildings it’s just like better<br>it’s just better reception period<br>and it’s not like a little bit better<br>it’s like several times better you know<br>it’s like the amount of drop offs that i get with horizon are so<br>tiny in comparison to the at amp t ones att just<br>they just got fucked by that iphone that iphone just<br>overloaded their network overloaded shit out of it<br>and the things just they just drop you know what<br>something that atnt has been pushing lately but i and i agree<br>is not being able to use your data network<br>while you’re on the phone<br>varizon you can’t<br>when you’re on the phone<br>you can’t check your email and get new email or go on<br>twitter and get new twitters<br>while you’re on the phone<br>you can’t use your data and your phone together<br>at the same time<br>did you know that<br>no i didn’t know that’s huge<br>that’s bigger than a drop call once in a while i think<br>yeah that is bigger<br>you don’t have no idea what i’m talking<br>no data and not be able to use data talk about yeah<br>because what if you’re on the phone you can’t get<br>you can’t get emails or you’re on the phone yeah<br>that’s gay that’s<br>and verizon can’t fix that with their current network<br>yeah that’s gay<br>that’s why they had that thing<br>where they show that you can get on the phone<br>and go any apps look<br>but that sucks it does suck but i’ll take<br>being able to use the phone over that<br>i like using the phone i like look what i’m driving<br>i get my business done you know what i’m saying<br>i have to get shit done and i have to talk to people<br>and sometimes i have conference calls sometimes i do interviews<br>while i’m driving my car<br>you know like you would call me up<br>and you’ll say something like what’s that<br>how do you do this or something like i’m on<br>my porn i can’t go my you can’t do anything that’s weak yeah<br>it is weak but i’ll take that and have a signal i’ll take<br>not being able to bolt the same time<br>and have a strong signal right<br>i’ll take that<br>and that’s because the cdma<br>can’t handle two streams at the same time right well<br>the verizon actually uses older technology ctd actually<br>has a newer technology which is varizon’s kind of been<br>in trouble yeah slower network<br>can’t handle those two things at once<br>yeah but it still works better<br>but i’ll take it right four g<br>isn’t out yet here<br>somebody wrote soldier boy is a fucking douche<br>listen do you think you would be any better<br>if you were nineteen years old and you would be sort of like<br>millions of dollars he has a juice on the internet<br>though where he’s showing his money and<br>stuff he’s a nineteen year old kid<br>that’s worth millions of dollars like literally

is if you have any streaming<br>you’re gonna have pirates dreaming yeah<br>we can’t stop that<br>i don’t think you can stop it<br>maybe you can<br>maybe you can stop it by<br>cutting back on those

bitches<br>wow there’s a lot of goddamn good<br>what of this marijuana and it increasing brain cells you know<br>i don’t know if it increases brain cells<br>there’s been some research that suggests that<br>and it suggests it also<br>slows down the progression of all timers i don’t know<br>it does it does a lot of good for you<br>though that’s what people need to<br>understand there’s a lot of drugs that are terrible for you<br>marijuana is not one of them<br>marijuana does a lot of good things for you<br>it calms you down<br>it relaxes you it makes you take things<br>i just got a text from bruce buffer powerful<br>it makes you<br>makes you consider other<br>options it makes you consider other<br>possibilities it makes you think<br>about yourself<br>more it makes you think about<br>whether or not you’re being a douchebag<br>you know whether or not you’re behaving the right way<br>marijuana is good for it<br>does it give you extra brain cells i don’t know<br>i was gonna write<br>the copy of the cover of my<br>shiny happy jihad the first<br>name for that cd was gonna be weed made me smarter<br>i was gonna call it that<br>but i decided that was kind of like<br>that

addicted to everything i get addicted to pool<br>i used to play pool eight hours a day<br>more even sometimes<br>i used to get addicted to video games that’s why<br>i’m scared of golf i’ve never played golf<br>i’m terrified of that shit because i know dudes to play golf<br>they can’t they sit around all day and practice fake swinging<br>it’s they get addicted you know and i get<br>very badly addicted to games<br>so i try to leave my addictions to things that benefit me now<br>like pool i like pool<br>i don’t<br>play as much as i used to i just fuck around with it but like<br>jiu jitsu and stand up comedy i try to be more<br>i try to be addicted to things that are<br>beneficial to me<br>instead of things that are just gonna like eat up all my day<br>which is what pool used to be<br>for me and what video games used to be for me<br>i used to have real fucking problems<br>thank you i’m glad you enjoyed the drawing<br>i twittered a drawing that i made when i was<br>i think i was like eighteen and nineteen years old<br>i used to want to be a comic book artist red dragons<br>indeed red dragons<br>have you seen the new preview for the new karate kid movie<br>no i have not it’s black karate kid<br>they’re redoing the karate kid but the kid’s black<br>and i think it’s will smith’s kid yeah<br>it’s will smith’s kid<br>that’s awesome we’re easy<br>karate’s making a comeback man the oda machida yeah<br>don’t fuck with the karate kid man<br>it’s marijuana would bring<br>california out of bankruptcy do you really think<br>so don’t fuck with the karate kid<br>you say that like the karate kid was like some awesome moving<br>dude it’s a childhood memory<br>they fucked up gi joe<br>they fucked up transformers with gi joe<br>whole childhood was gi joe<br>yes and it was the worst movie ever no<br>but it made me before that movie what<br>was it before<br>which is a cartoon series cartoons<br>right<br>they didn’t really fuck it up<br>though they just made a bad move it was horrible<br>though it was awful<br>how fast could bjpen bdaoke man<br>i don’t know if there’s anybody at one fifty five<br>they can fuck a bjpen now now<br>that bj’s taken everything like super serious and training<br>like a dedicated athlete<br>he’s a destroyer<br>at one fifty five just nobody that’s even close to him<br>i mean no one’s even in<br>his frequency<br>he’s in the matrix right now<br>you know there’s certain dudes that get to a certain point<br>with confidence with experience<br>with skill technique<br>and then you add discipline and conditioning to that<br>they get to this<br>crazy place that very few people can reach this crazy high air<br>and that’s where bj pens at right now right<br>anderson silva too he’s another one<br>he’s just in this air<br>nobody can fuck with<br>that that’s what’s good about the ultimate fighter<br>though because it’s kind of bringing new people in that<br>unknown people you know yeah<br>but you know<br>there’s such a gigantic gap<br>between<br>these guys that have fought in these smaller organizations<br>and the guys at the top of the food chain<br>and you see like with fador million inco like it takes so many<br>years for a guy to become like the fador of today<br>and anderson silva’s a perfect example<br>that like anderson silva when he’s fighting in<br>pride i mean he got submitted by riochonan<br>takasi got him in a mounted triangle those dudes were<br>beating him dudes were submitting him<br>you know i mean he knocked out carlos dune<br>but he just didn’t look like the anderson silver of today<br>and he had to have those fights he had to have those losses<br>he had to get better<br>he had to rise<br>he had to really get his shit together<br>really focus on his jujitsu and<br>really become black belt on the ground<br>so he had this full package<br>so that he was totally confident and throwing his strikes<br>cause he didn’t worry at all about being on the ground<br>and that’s the innocent silver ab now just like<br>fully complete fighter<br>but we had to see him evolve it took a long time for him<br>to become the guy that he is today<br>and that’s what it takes a long time to make like a full<br>complete mixed martial artist<br>and these guys today<br>i mean the competition is staggering<br>there’s so many fighters now<br>i mean there’s so many different organizations<br>so many fighters and so many guys are good it’s so hard<br>to advance and to you know<br>to make it to<br>the very top of the food<br>chain in today’s mix martial arts world<br>i mean it’s so much fucking competition<br>it’s amazing i mean when i first started doing the ufc<br>i first started working for them in nineteen ninety seven<br>and it was tiny<br>we did the first show in doth an alabama there was nobody there<br>i mean it was like a thousand people<br>or something like that on this because<br>the tickets were really cheap<br>and because people came to see a fucking freak show<br>there was nobody<br>there that knew when someone was passing the guard<br>and nobody passed the guard back then either<br>you know nobody knew what the fuck was going on<br>nobody knew you know<br>the leg kicks were you know<br>really bad for you that fuck your legs up people<br>would see a guy kick in someone in<br>the legs like what was he doing that<br>you know like<br>back<br>then you were allowed to punch people in the balls you know<br>you were allowed to pull hair<br>you were allowed to pull on clothes<br>crazy the early days did what it is now<br>it’s really fucking amazing<br>your face is amazing your fucking face is amazing<br>don fry retired from mma<br>don fry is a fucking real man that belongs in a movie<br>they should make a movie at a don fry<br>this fucking mustache alone is epic<br>don fry’s a real man ladies and gentlemen a real goddamn man<br>three hundred seventy two viewers i pay you this shit’s fine<br>they’re saying this sounds good<br>but i think this sounds better when we’ve got close<br>i think it just needs to point towards your face oh<br>really have it towards your fucking face<br>your face is pointing towards your face<br>where to float com<br>is that a website where to float com<br>if you google where to float<br>i know you can if you want to know about flotation tanks<br>these are what<br>this guy’s asking about is a thing called a sensory deprivation<br>tank and what that is is<br>there’s a tank filled with water<br>if you haven’t heard about this before<br>you could google it and there’s videos of that we made<br>that you could find online at brian made<br>if you see any of my videos from my website<br>and you go wow<br>those are fucking really cool and creative<br>this guy makes him<br>that’s brian rico he’s a fucking video genius bitches recognize<br>and<br>we made a really cool one up that explains the isolation tank<br>but what it is is<br>a tank of water that has<br>eight hundred pounds of salt in it and the water is heated<br>to the same temperature of your skin<br>and the salt makes you very<br>buoyant so you lie in the water and you float<br>and<br>the fact that the water is heated to the same<br>temperature as your skin<br>you don’t feel it<br>so you’re floating in this water<br>you don’t really feel the water anymore because the water<br>in the air and everything<br>it all feels like one thing it feels like you’re weightless<br>and you’re flying through space<br>and when you close the door in this thing<br>you’re in total darkness you’re in total silence<br>your ears are underwater you don’t hear anything<br>and in the absence of any sensory input you don’t hear anything<br>you don’t feel anything<br>you don’t see anything and the absence of all that<br>your mind has no distractions<br>and your brain becomes supercharged<br>and you start having<br>vivid hallucinations and you start<br>like it’s a really like a psychical experience you really start<br>you start like really like<br>researching<br>your thoughts and getting to the heart of who you are<br>separate from culture<br>separate from language<br>separate from you know your experiences<br>you get down to who you are<br>and then when you get to that<br>once you get past that is when the hallucination start<br>because you kind of cease to exist as<br>you define yourself as who you are by your job<br>the car you drive<br>the house you live in the family<br>you have the friends you keep<br>you define yourself by all these different things but<br>when you’re in that tank<br>all those things are gone<br>there’s no outside world<br>there’s just the mind<br>it’s the mind untethered from the body<br>and when you’re in that state<br>you kind of transverse<br>you’d kind of travel<br>between this consciousness and this reality to another one<br>you travel outside of this world<br>you travel to this the world of the deep inner thoughts<br>you know the deep inner connection<br>between whatever the fuck this life is<br>you know the connection<br>between your consciousness and the universe and it gets pretty<br>fucking crazy<br>i have one of those bitches in my basement i do it all the time<br>is it like a really great power nap no<br>it’s not like a really great power nap<br>it’s like a really great mushroom trip<br>but the best thing about it is you could end it in a second<br>anytime you want to end it<br>you just open up the door and your stone cold sober<br>so you can be in this deep trance where you’re you know<br>you’re i’ve had really<br>vivid vivid hallucinations in there where i felt like i was<br>like i had traveled down<br>to the very atomic structure of human beings<br>and gotten through the lowest point<br>and at that lowest point<br>as you get lower and lower and deeper and deeper<br>it became like another universe and the idea<br>in my head was that<br>all of this life that we see<br>you know sub atomic particles to atoms to all these like this<br>this progression<br>of things getting bigger and bigger and bigger to<br>humans to countries<br>to contents to planets to planets to galaxies to galaxies<br>to you know to universes and then all this idea<br>that things just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger well<br>it works infinitely in both directions<br>it was like i was taken on a trip through<br>the whole experience from<br>subatomic to atomic to planets to flying through space to<br>space being subatomic to<br>you know this new atom that exists<br>and it’s a part of new organisms that exists<br>that a part of a new ecosystem that exists<br>that’s part of a new planet that’s part of a new galaxy<br>that’s part of a new<br>universe and it goes on and on and on<br>and i went through this whole thing like over and over again<br>like multiple times and it was really fucking crazy<br>it was a very<br>very vivid and very realistic and very<br>you know very life changing the whole thing is like<br>doing it a lot you got to do the isolation tank a lot<br>and you got to learn to relax<br>and you gotta learn to give<br>into the experience because so many times when you’re in there<br>you’re thinking about things and you’re worried about things and<br>you think about your bills and your bullshit<br>and you know i’m gonna lose weight<br>and i got to do this<br>and all those thoughts<br>distract you it’s like<br>the state of mind that you can achieve<br>in the sites to listen tank<br>it’s very similar to the state of mind<br>that you can achieve<br>from you know when monks<br>go through you know decades and decades of intense meditation<br>like they achieve the same<br>type of state of mind<br>but you’re achieving it like with no discipline<br>so it’s hard to manage sometimes<br>but if you can learn to manage it and if you<br>learn to go in with the correct<br>thought process and to approach it the right way<br>and maybe meditate before<br>you go in and calm yourself<br>and put yourself in a good state of mind<br>and know how to navigate the waters of these experiences<br>then you can get to the crazy part<br>the crazy part it’s hard to get to but it’s there<br>we should ask them<br>which sounds better and switch between the three<br>okay<br>okay what sounds better well<br>there’s three settings to this microphone<br>this is what sounds better this is setting one ready hi<br>my name is

joe rogan dinner<br>ten p m and nintendo wine<br>joe rogan show<br>huh so you did it’s just saying that<br>you say it says there’s only one show yeah<br>i think there is only one show<br>i only have it on your website as one one show ten pm oh<br>this is gonna be a disaster yeah<br>oh it’s gonna be okay<br>crazy yeah if you want to go to the improv<br>you gotta go now i didn’t think so to sold out<br>try to buy a ticker right now<br>oh wait try to buy a ticket right there<br>oh there’s still tickets okay<br>you can still buy tickets but<br>get them quick because that bitch is gonna sell out<br>maybe we’ll add at eight o’clock show<br>i don’t want anybody to get shut out<br>and sometimes eight o’clock is the move you go there<br>have a show have a good time get your freak on<br>have a you know have a couple laughs and then go hide<br>when it comes to midnight so you don’t get bullets<br>dropping on your fucking head and all the douchebags out here<br>like the fired guns in the air and get crazy well<br>i can handle it and they<br>drink and drive and<br>it’s very dangerous i got some hilarious video of<br>last new year’s there of these old ladies<br>dancing and stuff oh yeah<br>that’s right<br>i wish we had that right now we’ll get streaming yeah<br>we’ll get streaming right yeah<br>i’m gonna upgrade this internet<br>weak ass internet i got here<br>because then once i’ll bring my laptop<br>and then i’ll<br>start to be able to just send you video<br>we’re gonna set it up<br>like our goddamn fucking tv studio in here bitches<br>three hundred fifty eight viewers<br>i’m losing viewers i must be boring fuck<br>answer some questions here<br>add a late show in vegas<br>i don’t think so man late shows in vegas are a nightmare<br>house of blues is pretty big already yeah<br>the house of blues is a good size anyway<br>i won’t the one thing that i won’t do anymore is that well<br>i used to do the house of blues and i had<br>most of the people were seated<br>but then there was a standing room in the back<br>the problem is<br>that standing room by the bar<br>it just becomes a bar and people just start talking<br>and it becomes a fucking nightmare so<br>no more shows i’m not doing any more shows ever anywhere<br>where people have to stand out<br>while they’re watching the show<br>and the reason<br>being is because i went to see doug stanhope when he was in la<br>and we went to see him<br>and we’re standing in the back of the room<br>because he did a standing room only show<br>and it was like after<br>like an hour like your fucking back<br>herds he next starts bothering you<br>and your it’s not comfortable to stand up and watch a show<br>i always figured<br>because i’m on stage<br>standing for an hour like it’s no big deal like you know<br>stand for an hour and a half and<br>talk on stage and it doesn’t feel it’s not a problem<br>but standing still<br>watching someone is a big difference<br>the worst it’s terrible<br>do you even remember like the last half of that show<br>because i was focused on my feet the whole time yeah<br>it’s a terrible feeling and what’s weird is<br>i talked to somebody in texas<br>they walked out of the show because it couldn’t<br>because it was all outstanding ramona yeah dougs show<br>and they just walked out<br>they’re like we couldn’t take it anymore yeah<br>i hate it<br>so i’m not doing it anymore and i’m having problems with this<br>because i had a show booked in march at the filmor<br>the filmor in new york city<br>and<br>they said that the whole balcony had to be standing i’m like<br>fuck that man<br>give me less money<br>let’s seep what we can and<br>but they were like you know<br>we can make more and money if people<br>stand i was alright<br>you’re done and so i canceled that gig<br>and then the same thing happened in houston<br>i was supposed to do<br>the house of blues and the same thing they were like well<br>you know we can’t we need to have people standing in the back<br>and i had it booked i don’t know<br>my agents are not communicating this to the people<br>or they’re not paying attention<br>it’s going through too many people before<br>it gets to the person that makes the decision but<br>they didn’t want they wanted to have people stand<br>and i said fuck that<br>so now<br>i’m gonna have to find a new gig in new york and new gig<br>in houston and i’m probably gonna wind up<br>doing the improv in houston i don’t know<br>thinking about that<br>and some maybe one of the clubs in new york city<br>if you go to joe’s twitter<br>a website that has his calendar on it you just gain four people<br>though so people like talking about standing yes<br>do you remember<br>do you remember<br>standing would like wait for a roller coaster<br>and just stand in like three<br>hours for a roller coaster like last<br>a minute yeah<br>fuck that terrible man<br>yeah<br>run it like tom green yeah<br>tom greens got an awesome setup<br>i went to tom green’s house where i filmed<br>his talk show there<br>and he’s got a fucking crazy setup man like<br>giant servers and he’s got wires big you know<br>wires all throughout his living room because like he’s doing it<br>like serious hardcore style and he’s doing it<br>or at least back then he was doing he’s still doing it isn’t he<br>or is he straight paper view now<br>that he can’t watch it for free at all now anymore right<br>i think<br>think so let’s go to tom green live and see<br>that is that the case<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>if it is i think that’s a fucking mistake<br>i think it is too<br>that’s a state maybe<br>it’s the archives you have to be a member to watch<br>that makes sense<br>maybe we’ll see we’re going to the channel<br>he calls it the channel i don’t know what that’s all

found out there was no santa because i stumbled in<br>and my parents rapping<br>shit oh really and i was like<br>and then i we opened it the next day i thought what the fuck<br>like i hid and i saw them right and then i just put two and<br>two together my friend has this video of her daughter last year<br>and her daughter was like i saw<br>santa claus last night he had a beard<br>and he had a big stomach and had the bell and the mom’s like oh<br>really really<br>can you imagine fucking lying no<br>you imagine watching that<br>i would have to correct the kid i was like listen<br>don’t lie stop you would have said that yeah<br>otherwise you can’t see<br>santa’s invisible no<br>you can’t lie to me i mean she was like she was like<br>four three she’s a liar<br>she’ll fucking see the video<br>i think it’s very important<br>to call kids on being a i was a liar when i was a little kid<br>that’s what i’m saying this<br>i had a very vivid imagination and not such a good life<br>so it would always make up stories<br>and i wish somebody called me on my bullshit then<br>so wouldn’t take it so long for me to figure out on my own<br>the people knew i was like right<br>i didn’t figured out those like ten<br>you would think pinocchio would have worked<br>you know when you’re a kid watching pinocchio<br>i don’t want to know<br>he’s made of wood wooden<br>people can’t fucking talk man

twitters<br>oh it’s good it’s coming in now<br>will ufc ever have a one thirty five division<br>i think the ufc in the w<br>e c the idea is eventually<br>that it’s gonna be one thing when i don’t know<br>but i think it should be because i think guys like<br>jose aldo and yuria faber and mike brown<br>and miguel torres those guys are fucking awesome they deserve<br>all the attention that the ufc gets they deserve people<br>to you know to be clamoring for super fights and to see<br>big paper view<br>bouts and you know<br>madison square garden and fucking you know<br>the the mgm grand<br>they those guys deserve to be a<br>those kind of shows i mean the level of talent<br>in the wc right now is<br>staggering and thirty five<br>hundred forty five pound division<br>i mean these guys are fucking animals man<br>and even one fifty five they have some awesome fighters<br>i think it’d be beneficial to everybody if it was all<br>the ufc was all one thing<br>now especially since they own the wc<br>i think it would help everybody if they could make that happen<br>if it’s possible<br>rigorous sack says use that little kid liar in the act<br>i don’t know if that’s really funny sir<br>i think that’s<br>funny right now<br>because we’re talking about right now<br>but i don’t know if you could recreate that<br>it’s not funny enough<br>to recreate that and say it on stage might be<br>might be when you’re talking about<br>if my daughter gets the age where<br>my uh have you wrote any new conspiracy theory<br>kind of comedy lately<br>because i remember<br>used to be really big

tanner tribute beard i had a good one going<br>but i had to shave it for something i had to do<br>rejoined the human<br>rejoint society well back when i came back from colorado too<br>i was really thinking about growing one in colorado<br>but that might<br>push me well over the edge<br>when i was living in colorado on the top of a mountain<br>if i had a beard up there<br>too i probably would have got way close to an animal<br>you know<br>if i let myself off with crazy hairy was there any point<br>love living there like that you were just outside<br>and you were just like holy shit this is scary<br>you know what am i doing here definitely<br>definitely it was definitely scary<br>but that was part of the appeal of it to me is that it was so<br>off the grid right<br>it was so outside of the way a normal person<br>every day gets to experience life<br>i was living in the fucking woods<br>not just kinda in the woods<br>i was living on a hundred and fifty acres<br>on the top of a mountain in boulder colorado<br>outside of boulder<br>i mean it was like nine miles above boulder it was pretty<br>trippy eighty<br>five hundred feet above sea level<br>and all source of wildlife deer every day<br>deer i was on a dirt road for eight miles deer<br>every day i would see deer<br>every day i would see foxes<br>occasionally i would see porcupines people saw bear<br>i never saw bear<br>saw mount line in my backyard i mean<br>you saw a lot of shit eagles all the time<br>i mean it was really intense it was so<br>real you know<br>it was so like<br>you know you’re driving you see in wild animals<br>like real wild animals big fucking<br>ten point bucks walking down the street you know<br>and it’s very very interesting it’s<br>just the fact that you can live somewhere like that it’s such a<br>i think people get stuck in the patterns<br>and i think it’s really easy to get<br>stuck in the same<br>way of thinking the same way of looking at the world<br>and nothing changes that like moving to a new place for a while<br>and moving to a place<br>that’s as stunning is the mountains of colorado<br>I would love to go back but<br>it’s just not practical to have a wife and kids and<br>you know and have little vulnerable babies<br>and being around fucking wild monsters<br>I mean my dog got eaten by a mountain line<br>when we’re up there<br>that’s for real<br>like we saw a mountain lion<br>I let the little dog out by himself dog disappears<br>I mean that dog got eaten by a fucking mountain lion<br>you know which is very likely<br>and<br>those animals died a predation up there all the time<br>it’s very common<br>they even prey on animals they get used to them<br>they get used to<br>recognizing and associating the barks<br>barks of these animals with like<br>prey and so they go towards where they hear barks<br>so it’s actually<br>kind of dangerous<br>when you have a fucking house with dogs barking<br>because sometimes these mountain lines<br>like if they’re hungry especially if they’re old<br>and they can’t catch deer anymore<br>they know these dogs are like in a cage<br>they hop over that fence like it ain’t shit<br>jack dogs they do it all the time<br>they’re scary as fuck<br>do you think<br>people that sleep with guns underneath their pillows<br>if that’s just fake<br>somebody said it wants to impress a girl<br>oh no I know a guy who does it really<br>yeah don’t you is that just seem the most like<br>that’s dumb well<br>if you want it and you want it to have it right there<br>if you live in a place<br>where you think you’re gonna need it right there<br>I mean look it doesn’t seem like it’s a good idea<br>but what if<br>someone breaks in your house and you need the gun<br>and you just go like that<br>and you got the gun<br>and then that keeps you alive<br>you know there’s that way of looking at it<br>you know there’s the way of looking at it like hey man<br>if you think that way man<br>fucking nothing can happen to you man<br>as long as you think positive you can think that way<br>you could be one of those dudes that goes through life<br>convinced<br>that nothing ever bad is going to happen to you<br>you know<br>I mean that is possible you might sneak through<br>but shit might get ugly<br>and or shit gets ugly<br>you want one of these bitches<br>this shit’s important<br>that’s cool we gotta have guns ladies and gentlemen<br>I believe in the second amendment<br>that’s really cool<br>I believe<br>dude we should go shooting sometime<br>I haven’t been shooting it so long<br>it’s really let’s go yeah<br>I want to go shooting so bad let’s go go<br>let’s go on Monday cool<br>I think<br>yeah definitely<br>gun controls important<br>you gotta definitely screen people<br>you gotta definitely make sure that people don’t<br>you know that<br>the people can’t get access<br>to guns that are fucking crazy<br>and that you know<br>and that’s the problem with a lot of gun shows<br>there’s a lot of people<br>that sell guns at gun shows that don’t give a fuck<br>if you’re licensed or not<br>they’re just trying to make some money and<br>there’s been expos aires on that where they’ve shown<br>that people in gun shows will sell guns to people<br>that don’t you know<br>not really supposed to have guns<br>but<br>the guns are out there<br>they’re fucking out there there’s millions of them<br>you should have one<br>you know if there’s millions of guns out there<br>better to have it<br>and did not need it than to need it and not have it<br>that’s you know<br>I’m an optimist<br>I’m not a pessimist I’m not you know I believe<br>that most human beings are good<br>but I’ve come across way too many fucked up people<br>to have<br>complete and total blind trust in the human race<br>I just don’t<br>I’ve seen way too many fucked up violent things happen<br>I’ve seen way too many crazy people<br>I’ve come in contact with and had to deal with<br>way too many fucking crazy people<br>there’s a lot of people out there that you can’t reason<br>with there’s a lot of people out there that are just<br>broken and nuts<br>and that’s real<br>oh is that santa’s bells<br>santa’s bells is leaving about santa’s bells<br>no no

that dogged a bounty hunter wears holla<br>that’s hilarious<br>all right ladies and gentlemen<br>this has been very interesting<br>we were up to 379 motherfuckers<br>I want to thank you for tuning in<br>this is we’re gonna do this much more often<br>now that I have this set up<br>and I finally<br>installed this webcam that I bought<br>like 5 5 5 5 years ago<br>you gotta get your internet updated you got new hd<br>I’m gonna get my internet updated<br>they have hd cameras now<br>59 bucks amazon look for them for this<br>yeah oh no you don’t that’s actually an old camera now<br>that’s not good yeah<br>but it looks okay<br>yeah it looks okay but see it’s not an hd<br>you can be broadcasting hd right now<br>but isn’t that like more bandwidth preview to download<br>yeah but not when you have 20 megabytes you know<br>oh but crazy it doesn’t affect<br>them it affects<br>them downloading it it only affects up Australia<br>yeah once I get the internet do it<br>I’ll make it hd so you can see ugly am<br>alright what else we got here<br>one of the next time I’m gonna be used streaming<br>johnny bananas<br>that’s a very good question<br>I think what I’m gonna try to do is<br>my ultimate goal in 2010 is<br>I’m trying to write a book right now<br>and I’ve been spending a lot of time writing that<br>and writing stand up comedy and not so much time<br>updating my website<br>but I do go on Twitter because Twitter is fun for me<br>and it’s like a little exercise in writing<br>to make things short<br>make them 140 characters<br>I think that’s fun<br>it is it’s like it teaches you to like<br>you know edit your shit yeah<br>and with comedy that’s very important<br>economy of words is what it’s called<br>and a stand up comedy<br>it’s very important<br>the less words you could use to make a point<br>the funnier it’s going to be when it hits people<br>the more you know the more verbose it is the more<br>it’s not funny when it gets there<br>so I think Twitter is real good for that<br>but my point is in 2010 what I’m my mango is more<br>on the internet<br>more shit like this more usedream shit<br>more Twitter and definitely more blogs<br>but I’m gonna start doing more video shit and<br>I’m carrying I got a cool flip thing<br>from the ufc for Christmas which is perfect<br>I’m gonna bring that bitch with me everywhere<br>and we’re gonna<br>start putting shit online on YouTube<br>on a really regular basis<br>and I know there’s a little u stream<br>streaming thing for the iphone<br>we’re gonna try that shit out but it’s probably gay<br>yeah everyone wi fi it’s not

computer<br>you know why fuck around unless you’re at denny’s<br>you know denny says wi fi yeah<br>any place that’s wi fi welcome to 2009 people<br>shit is getting crazy<br>well listen<br>I gotta go I
