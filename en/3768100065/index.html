didn’t have a language and couldn’t say hey<br>fucking stop you couldn’t fight someone off<br>back in those days<br>no rape it was just rape<br>if you couldn’t like<br>reason<br>with people and say listen when you’re raping me<br>you’re hurting me<br>I know it feels good temporarily<br>but there’s other solutions<br>you can’t talk someone out of rape<br>when there’s no language<br>right they just tack your house<br>right I mean that’s logic right<br>do you think a girl that’s in a coma is just like a<br>robot fuck doll<br>no she didn’t do anything<br>no that’s rude man that’s not a doll

joe’s message board it’s under the topic on the<br>called I can’t wait till my cell phone does this<br>and it’s this company that does special effects<br>so that you could pretty much<br>and it shows like all their samples<br>and it’s just like<br>backgrounds of buildings that you’d never<br>think was a green screen<br>and it just shows you like the scenes first<br>and then it shows how to use<br>yeah it’s amazing<br>could you imagine if you could do that with your phone<br>if you could put your phone down<br>and change what you’re looking at<br>you know that’s what’s going to happen eventually<br>when they figure out how to broadcast images<br>and make them look<br>real like it’s right in front of you<br>like not just on a screen<br>but an actual hologram<br>that looks real right in front of you<br>god damn could you imagine<br>when your tv becomes something that you just<br>place in the middle of your living room you put it down<br>you try it on<br>and the image just comes out of it<br>I’ll be one yeah<br>man like old school princess leia like shit<br>but like you can’t tell the difference though<br>you know what I mean<br>how intense would that be<br>we’ll start off like vhs quality where you’re like<br>I can kind of tell the difference<br>it’s not statically it’s gonna happen<br>tweedy television was the big thing<br>fuck wearing three d glasses though<br>no they said one of them has one you don’t have to<br>well I didn’t see the avatar in three d<br>I saw it in regular<br>and even in regular<br>holy fucking shit that movie’s good<br>yeah<br>it’s not like a good movie like really great writing<br>you can’t believe they weren’t there<br>you see everything coming a mile away<br>and you don’t care<br>I probably extended it but it’s like<br>I just feel like I’ll leave growing<br>no you’re not gonna say it’s alright<br>if you get super baked<br>you’re gonna love the fuck out of that movie<br>it’s so did you see it<br>no either it has<br>yeah I don’t think the problem is I haven’t seen it<br>I see through storylines to it hilarious<br>you guys are both nerd<br>listen are you gonna see through the storyline<br>you’re gonna see through the storyline<br>but it’s not gonna matter<br>but it’s not for that it’s a comic book man<br>it’s bullshit<br>it’s just entertainment<br>just pretend like you’re 15 again<br>you’re just watching some stupid action<br>oh my god is their good action<br>jesus fucking christ bro I didn’t want<br>to tell you about it because I don’t want to ruin it<br>I don’t want to be the<br>that’s my<br>spy movies or shit like that or just action movie<br>fuck a spy movie this thing’s off the chart<br>and I didn’t even see it in three d<br>apparently in three d<br>it’s insane my block said that<br>sweeties and moss<br>he sees movies like<br>more than anybody but imax is not necessary<br>oh he said he had to go through to you but not imax<br>you can take her to leave it<br>he’s probably seen 10 times already right<br>I’ve seen it a few times<br>if you mic black<br>if you talk to him on a Tuesday<br>say you want to see a movie<br>he’s already seen everything<br>jesus yeah every week<br>he just goes every week right now<br>he’s always gets that midnight showing<br>I love movies when they’re good<br>like avatar was a great experience<br>there’s something<br>I believe there’s something<br>about seeing a movie in front of a bunch of people too<br>it’s a totally different experience<br>watch a movie by yourself sometimes<br>you know when it’s a shitty movie<br>then you’re just watching a movie<br>a shitty movie with a bunch of people<br>it sucks you that’s true we also helped with three<br>yeah and we still walked like yeah<br>that was terrible<br>that movie was so dumb<br>I couldn’t I know but I think they’re hellboy fans<br>they’re fans of the comic book first<br>and that’s what we fucked up on<br>we didn’t know what was going on<br>I couldn’t get high enough<br>no it’s the responsibility of the movie<br>to make you understand even if you’re not a fan<br>yes but that’s what that happens in those big<br>like big story things like harry potter<br>I saw the last harry potter<br>yeah which fuck it was death<br>I couldn’t I couldn’t wait for it to be over<br>it was like being in jail<br>it was terrible<br>was it wasn’t even remotely entertaining<br>was nothing entertaining about<br>I saw why harry potter was pretty good<br>yeah the first one was really<br>really the first couple were good<br>well they had that broom ball thing<br>yeah that was a fucking dope<br>I don’t remind one of the second ones<br>I think the second one was<br>when the dragon was coming after<br>was that the second one<br>I think that was<br>you know<br>I think that was a third one the third one with a tree<br>that dragon scene was worth the whole movie and me<br>like everybody talked about how the hulk sucked<br>that hulk totally sucked<br>but when he’s fucking shit up man it’s worth it<br>that’s good that was<br>all the new marvel movies have been pretty good<br>the iron man was fucking insane<br>the new one looks even crazier and that’s gonna be<br>I made a good story along with the action<br>I couldn’t watch wolverine man<br>the lazy wolverine was stupid<br>I’m sure the action was just as good as some other<br>shh stuff but it’s like<br>nothing’s ripping you<br>it’s too predictable<br>like there’s like there’s the scene where<br>the gasoline’s running away from the car<br>and he’s walking away and he likes the gasoline<br>the car blows up behind him<br>how many fucking times can you see that no yeah<br>that fucking scene is so weird and they don’t even look<br>exactly exactly what I thought that was just key for<br>yeah it’s so stupid so like I’m a badass<br>you know that you gotta come up with a new way to be<br>the new badass isn’t like some guys<br>like snarling and<br>the new badass is the guy like fade or it doesn’t say<br>shit this is no image<br>I would do it<br>I try to be cool and light<br>it start to walk away but then I start to<br>assume it’s gonna happen<br>so I start gonna like yeah<br>and I’m like wait<br>what’s happening and then we’re blowing<br>you gonna look out for scrapping<br>yeah stupid<br>I can assume it’s not gonna hate you<br>it’s gonna fuck blow up back there<br>it’s gonna come flying at you man<br>I don’t make my trail so long and around a building<br>yeah I would run like I’ll still pay a bum delighted<br>I could still want to see<br>yeah pay a bum delighter that’s the move<br>look I’m pretty sure in the movies<br>what was that maybe they died during that in the movies<br>never you could talk some sense of them<br>he’d be like yup yup yup<br>that’d be a great end to a movie<br>have a guy like the cigarette<br>put it out and then just ow and just die<br>yeah that would be<br>that would we’ve crazy<br>I’ve talked to you guys about this before<br>we’re gonna be awesome to have a job to watch<br>and moving and just<br>your whole<br>job was just going alright I totally wouldn’t do that<br>I wouldn’t keep<br>my keys on the dashboard lawn at McDonald’s<br>you know or something<br>you know just right<br>because there’s so many movies you’re into<br>and then you’re like<br>oh what’s right<br>so it seems like<br>they can be cute yes professional Hollywood nitpicker<br>you should start at agency<br>they have that thing where they do<br>where people go to see tv shows and they go<br>it’s probably they probably have that already<br>and it’s like the gafford<br>but we just never knew what the gaffer was<br>but it’s like<br>if you’re bugging one person<br>you’re probably bugging a whole bunch of people<br>yeah yeah totally and people just deal with it<br>you know it’s like<br>girls that won’t tell you that your breast stinks<br>but the more you have to do that<br>the more takes you out of the movie<br>yeah totally yeah<br>well there’s some scenes like that in avatar definitely<br>there’s a couple of scenes like that would be like<br>you didn’t have to do<br>it was just<br>there was a few cliches that were like so extreme<br>it was almost like it wasn’t even a movie<br>it was like this is how clunky some of the acting was<br>even cigorny weaver was so clunky<br>it wasn’t like it was a movie<br>it was like you know how you go to universal studios<br>and you go on a ride<br>and before the ride you play that little video<br>it was like that oh really yeah and you like that yeah<br>okay go back in but you’re not fully back in<br>the great chains were just so off the charts<br>that in zombieland<br>it was pretty good<br>but the chicks that I’m<br>lying at the end is almost like you had me at hello<br>oh you’re doing<br>and all of a sudden I’m like oh I’m watching a movie<br>yeah<br>but isn’t that what that whole movie was kind of about<br>cheesy humor mixed with zombies<br>and this is what I want to know<br>is there a single human being humor<br>is there a single human being that saw the ads for that<br>fucking let me tell you about the morgans that<br>you know<br>that the movie with sarah jessica parker at hugh grant<br>the new one that’s out now<br>something about the morgans<br>these are a fucking single human who saw that<br>that ad went fuck yeah<br>yeah there had to be<br>isn’t that I’m sure this huge sarah jessica<br>parker pants oh yeah<br>but even a huge sarah jessica parker friend<br>doesn’t give a fuck about hugram<br>you know it’s gotta be somebody who was<br>coked out of their mind<br>when a green lit that fucking movie<br>I think we got a winner here<br>we got hugh grant and we got sarah jessica parker<br>and then someone pulls the guy aside<br>yeah but it’s 2010<br>you must suck to if you’re a screaming and you’re like<br>here you’re like I’m thinking about brad pitt and<br>julie’s awesome is like and in the studio sometimes<br>hey instead of that<br>we’re going with<br>these guys won’t keep a little low budget<br>no no<br>why would you<br>well they’re committed<br>they have two projects going right now<br>it would be at least a year and a half<br>this script is so good<br>we don’t need stars we don’t need beauty<br>we don’t need talent but it’s your girl<br>it’s been so good<br>we want a guy that got arrested<br>for getting blown by black hookers<br>remember that disgusting one yeah<br>ruined his career sort of but not really right<br>he kind of came back out there they all come back<br>you know you could get<br>you could get busted doing something like that<br>if you’re an actor and for some reason<br>it’s okay you gotta have projects in the works already<br>they don’t want to speed the money<br>yes crane didn’t have anything in the works<br>yeah if you’ve got projects in<br>the workshop well he’d never had anything in the worst<br>she was a weird fuck like<br>mel gibson had like three things comments<br>were they gonna do not show them<br>let’s talk shit about cramer<br>did you<br>did you ever have to deal with him<br>did jews<br>did you ever have to deal with him at the college store<br>yeah I saw him<br>not in a bad way<br>I saw him<br>when he got there and I was like oh cool<br>scramber’s here you know<br>I just thought he wasn’t really there<br>yeah he wasn’t into him<br>but then he saw my stage like oh this isn’t good<br>people stop people stop like being weirded out by<br>I was like oh I called you that night before<br>it happened yeah<br>dude kramers here<br>he’s fucking like on crack or something<br>he’s with some crazy chick<br>and then like an hour later that all happened<br>it was either brent ernst or master brownie<br>was he one kid told us<br>he came back from the laugh<br>factory and told us he was like brent<br>what is he brent brent<br>the RET yeah brent that’s what I was saying<br>I thought you said brent<br>no I said brett you said brent okay<br>I said brent anyway<br>he came over and just told the two<br>kramer went fucking crazy<br>started young nigger people and we were like what<br>but we thought it was like another one of those things<br>in the world of comedy<br>you always hear about some chilling hey<br>you hear what happened to the costume last night<br>tom Paris pulled his cock out<br>and slapped some bleeding in the face<br>that you like<br>shut the fuck up<br>as she’s so in man it’s getting crazy<br>that’s normal it’s like cool<br>I wish I would have been there<br>I left like an hour<br>yeah yeah you’d be pissed off<br>well I’ll see<br>that’s one of the things<br>about the old school comedy stores<br>you never wanted to go<br>home because you never knew what the fuck was gonna<br>I made a mistake of thinking of shows over<br>where her guy<br>was miming out<br>being broken up with by a porn star<br>as she started fondling and touching her boyfriend<br>that was there and he was like please pickarvoni<br>please take me back<br>I can change<br>and then they got on stage I thought it was done<br>I was like ah that was a great night<br>I left later that porn star was fucking<br>her boyfriend right to the side of the stage<br>while everybody was washing yeah well<br>there was some stage racing<br>goddamn and I’m like why would I have gone home<br>I just seen leg was all wrapped up<br>that shit will happen all the time that comes to<br>you never know what you’re gonna see<br>there<br>a lot of penis<br>a lot of penis at the comic store<br>seems like everyone wants to show you<br>their dick why did<br>comedy comics like that<br>it’s so funny because it’s fine lipstick is hilarious<br>lipstick with your balls like to say<br>classic gross penis<br>is a chick’s name that was on stage<br>where joey was in the back of the room<br>at the original room<br>he came out and kept poland’s balls out<br>and she thought she was kellen<br>he would come out<br>she was terrible she was a terrible communion christie<br>I forget what a name no no no<br>anyway whatever the chick’s name was<br>she’s on stage and she’s one of those<br>lifers that had been doing comedy like<br>twenty plus years but it never made a living<br>adam but she’s<br>the comedy store kind of like kept those people around<br>whereas like those people like<br>the really crazy people that are<br>not really in the world of comedy<br>but they’re sort of in the world of comedy<br>they don’t get up at the improv they don’t get<br>but at the store those people would get up<br>at the basis and they really want their stage time<br>and they want to see them<br>and panic when you see them on the lineup<br>because you thought they would clear their room out<br>they would<br>they would usually will clear that fucking room<br>eight time better time<br>yeah and so anyway so she’s on stage<br>and every time she goes near bucks like<br>we all seen her act 1 million times<br>jelly diaz<br>is behind her the way the original room worked<br>you could actually<br>sneak up on somebody while they’re on stage<br>open up the curtain and grab them pull into the dark<br>there’s a curtain right there<br>and you can fully stand back there<br>totally a room<br>plenty of room you got like this much room<br>so joey goes back there<br>takes all his fucking clothes off<br>and every time she hits the punchline he pulls open<br>the curtain and<br>shake his balls and his big<br>giant grapefruit balls or slap it around<br>and then he would close it back up<br>and she didn’t see shit<br>she thought she was slaying<br>she thought she was slaying<br>she’ll go you guys like that one<br>like she was all jolly and happy like<br>all of a sudden she figured comedy out like yes<br>my hard work has come to fruition<br>and when that happens to the whole back row<br>fills it with comedians<br>and the comedian that’s in the stage is like oh cool<br>the comics are watching with it<br>but whatever<br>you know we’ve seen so much crazy shit at that place<br>in fact the comedy store<br>the old school<br>hangouts were the best part about the comedy store<br>the audiences were some of the worst ever<br>which is one of the reasons why you develop like<br>like people are saying you know<br>oh you know you’re always dealing with heckler’s like<br>you know what is that like is that is that freaky out<br>like when you start out at the<br>comedy store dude you have to deal with heckler no<br>it’s not every test but it’s like<br>1 out of 5 the only time they get rid of the guys<br>when violence is about to happen<br>it gets like to the point of violence<br>like people are standing up screaming at people<br>and you really need audience members that come<br>to the booth to complain yeah<br>about a different audience<br>yeah you need like people ready to stab people<br>for them to do anything<br>otherwise they wouldn’t do shit<br>so you develop that style<br>the style that you like you have and I have<br>and joey has where you could just<br>flip around<br>you don’t say you’re at from beginning to end<br>like some people<br>especially like<br>a lot of guys who<br>start out in clubs like in New York<br>you get really short sets<br>you know you don’t get to fuck around on stage<br>for a half an hour or an hour<br>you know you don’t get like<br>those nice<br>long sets and when you get those nice long sets<br>then you could put material where you want<br>it and fuck around<br>and be loose<br>and it’s got a lot to talk about the low dual showcase<br>it’s like do some 7min to get ready<br>you don’t have time to like hey<br>what’s up everybody you don’t have time at all<br>go go go and get off<br>like<br>isn’t it frustrated to you when you have to do a tv<br>show and<br>you have to do like 7min you like shit it’s not a time<br>a bit and a half a bit<br>and you don’t know how to set it up<br>it’s like yeah this is a good bit but it’s really good<br>after<br>I’ve been talking for 10min and you know my personality<br>you know I’m coming from<br>it’s different<br>yeah yeah it’s totally people do 7min<br>that’s only pretty much are better at that<br>yeah I know yeah<br>they’re more realized that potential<br>than someone who’s reduced a long<br>sets of hats to cut it down<br>yeah you get used to what you can get away with<br>you can’t really dig a hole<br>and you really know you’re pixing<br>yeah if you dig a hole in 7min like<br>there’s bits that I have where I know<br>like the baby blowjob bit<br>that’s that’s a possible hole<br>anytime that someone can follow<br>that can’t open with that fucking thing<br>people be like what<br>no you can’t talk about this yet<br>I don’t know how you think<br>but if they know how you think they know all this guy<br>just being silly<br>he’s just fucking around<br>he’s a really nice guy and he realizes<br>this is all in fun<br>we’re just having a good time up here<br>then people will accept<br>craziness if they know it’s all bullshit<br>but if they don’t know you you can’t just go on stage<br>and you might have this killer<br>brilliant bit but you’ll do the<br>first opening line of it<br>and they’ll just start eating it right away<br>you like fuck<br>yeah it’s like<br>when I got a hole<br>I have a format hole I have to fill this night<br>I’ve just dropped the pit right now I’ll take fuck it<br>I’ll do something else<br>the real I mean real comedy is<br>in front of an audience and comedy<br>any comedy on television<br>even comedy<br>like when I felt like I did my comedy special<br>like I’m happy that people could get ahold of it<br>but it’s really just an ad<br>it’s the best that I<br>think yeah it’s I mean<br>it’s nice it’s got the material down<br>and you know you can see it without having to<br>drive across the country to work<br>yeah people like whoa what it was a difference<br>I could<br>still see the jokes to see exactly what they saw<br>it’s like no you don’t<br>because<br>I’ll spend you what you missed as the connection<br>you try to make<br>with an audience<br>and you weren’t in that audience<br>and they didn’t feel that<br>yeah feel and hear the same things you heard<br>that’s a huge point<br>right there the connection<br>because it discounts<br>just the jokes that are really yes<br>it’s not<br>you can’t discount it<br>it’s a<br>real thing that’s happening with you in the audience<br>it’s very strange it’s like<br>almost like a psychic connection<br>you know like there’s moments where they<br>know exactly what you’re thinking and<br>you can just pause and consider something<br>and they’ll start laughing cause they know<br>by based on you know what they’ve gone<br>yeah they’re going there with you<br>I don’t have to judge other comics by watching my tv<br>but I do and I try to tell myself maybe<br>the same thing<br>I just heard not to it still looks right<br>it looks like yeah that’s where they’re doing<br>sony just sent me a tape of some guy check out<br>this guy thinks really funny<br>and I was like watching the clip<br>but I’m like I am<br>no yeah no I saw the leak laurie clamorton remember her<br>no New York<br>I think January first or 2nd she was doing a show<br>somebody threw<br>a roll letter a bread roll<br>it was just a heckler video<br>and I was watching it look<br>it’s pretty good<br>but if I was there<br>I’d be like oh this fucking great you know<br>you don’t know what’s gonna happen<br>you caught up in the moment<br>yeah it’s a complete thing and she knows that<br>about the crowd<br>that’s how she does a certain way<br>people love that<br>when moments just happen<br>when you’re in the middle of a show<br>you know<br>stand up comedy really is sort of like a mass hypnosis<br>it’s like some weird mass connection with people<br>and what you’re doing with<br>like a video is you’re just hoping that someone will<br>sort of get a little bit of that connection<br>yeah you know you’ll get like a little<br>like a little vibration of it a little<br>just a like a faint<br>memory of that connection<br>you get the material and you understand<br>good writing all that stuff<br>but there’s a moment that happens when you’re on stage<br>and you’re killing<br>you know that moment where it’s just writing it<br>we are feeling man<br>I don’t think too many people understand that<br>you know<br>well people talk about logos who’s commonly scary<br>it’s not scary<br>people want to have a good time<br>you just got to do what you’re supposed to do<br>do put into work write a lot<br>perform a lot<br>do it with the right state of mind<br>do it the right intentions do it all for fun<br>as long as you work you’re<br>if you’re intelligent you’ve been doing it<br>you know how to do it<br>just fucking do it man<br>the only time I heard is cal scara’s<br>jonathan gapsock was on stage once<br>I don’t know like 11th or whatever it was<br>and he was just killing right from the start<br>you started fucking destroyed and you seen about like<br>10 or 12min going<br>I’ve done that<br>I mean hiccups<br>because<br>he realized this might be the best set of all time<br>and then he’s like yeah<br>and the last<br>like 3min would probably like a b plus a minus<br>and it was like oh<br>but it was like oh my god I’m doing so well<br>he felt responsible for the rest of the set<br>I was like how’d totally done that<br>have you ever you talked yourself out of killing<br>yeah really what happened to me that’s good<br>I started eating it<br>I remember there was a set that I had when I first<br>started doing comedy with a<br>first 5min I fucking crushed<br>and then I had a 10min set and then I dropped a glass<br>yeah I just<br>fumbled dropped the glass and didn’t even address it<br>wasn’t it<br>yeah I’m not killing<br>yeah<br>I can’t extract and then the next 5min I just ate shit<br>I fucking ate shit man<br>it was like I went through everybody laughing and wow<br>this guy’s really funny<br>what a great choice<br>we picked a common show<br>this is awesome<br>because it was like in some<br>weird place in the middle of road island<br>it wasn’t even a comedy club<br>it was like one of these<br>little comedy gigs that you would get<br>where you know you chop it and do a guest spot<br>like before you were actually getting paid<br>you know<br>it took me like a year before I ever got any paid sets<br>but before that year there was always<br>guys that had like these little bar<br>rooms and you can go up in two ten minutes<br>like in Boston<br>they developed a whole network of those<br>there was shows everywhere<br>they had comedy night all over the place<br>when I was doing<br>comedy they had three comedy clubs on one block<br>warranton street 3 on 1 block<br>and a fourth one to open upstairs<br>they were all packed<br>it was crazy and then you had another one<br>that was only a block away<br>that was a little dipped already place<br>and then you had another one stitches<br>that was only a couple miles away<br>and then on route one you had two huge ones<br>you had the caloons and you had giggles<br>these are like<br>full time clubs like giggles wasn’t collins or<br>maybe I think was just a weekend one too<br>but the other ones were seven day a week club<br>so how many people involves them<br>I don’t know there’s a few million but it was crazy man<br>there was stitches<br>there was a duck soup which was later<br>later became the improv<br>and then it was of course the next comedy stuff<br>there were so many fucking clubs<br>it was the most incredible play<br>it was so lucky<br>just a total streak of luck that I was in<br>Boston in 1988 when I wanted to do comedy<br>cause that was like<br>that was like mecca how much space time<br>and it was mecca for the cold country<br>for whatever reason that one place<br>developed all these comics<br>I mean like I’m a not dennis leary<br>what’s his face steven wright<br>and then guys you’ve never heard of jay leno of course<br>nictopolo anthony clark<br>anthony clark back then was a murderer dude<br>thanks yeah he you know<br>I think he got a television show<br>and things started happen from and<br>I

she’s gone<br>is she dirty or she’s supposed to be really dirty<br>it’s just a good market<br>or I don’t think she’s way dirty in the rest of him<br>um she looks pretty dirty<br>jesus<br>what happened brian brian’s acting like john candy<br>think balancing on this<br>you don’t know what the fuck you’re doing man<br>you’re doing everything<br>this is a story behind this thing behind us<br>and I’m gonna put something in front of it<br>is that a bunch of pot on the ground<br>yep<br>this sign<br>when doug stan hope and I were hosted the man show<br>there was a segment called make me hard<br>and the segment<br>we had like boxes attached to dude’s dicks<br>and like we would show them things<br>like a midget eating a banana and<br>we would decide oh he’s getting a heart on<br>it was really stupid but the whole reason for the bit<br>was so that we could use this tranning<br>and<br>in the bit we had this tranny and she was really hot<br>I mean she’s fucking super hot<br>like my friend eddie saw her in a car once<br>and he goes damn that bitch is hot<br>look at her and I go dude that’s a tranny<br>and he goes no fucking michael<br>yeah<br>we used her on the mansion so I’m like hey what’s up<br>how are you doing so anyway<br>we got this guy with the box on<br>so the idea is that we show them all the stuff that’s<br>not sexy like guys playing with their nipples<br>big fat guys and the light would go off you know<br>midgets eating a banana their light would go off<br>and then we had this super hot chick<br>and she’s rubbing on him and she’s touched him<br>and nothing nothing’s happened<br>his light is not going off<br>and she’s pulls her tits out though<br>fuck it audience is going crazy<br>and he’s sucking whipped cream off her tits<br>and then she pulls her cock out<br>and her cock is this<br>wrinkled shriveled<br>up little poison dick because it’s a real dick like<br>she used to be a man<br>but she’s been injecting herself with so many<br>female hormones that her dick is like<br>like a dick that’s been poisoned<br>it was like a monkey that got<br>shot with a poisoned dart<br>which you would imagine his dick would look like<br>it was dark and shriveled up<br>and then of course the lights going off like crazy<br>ding ding ding ding ding ding<br>but they let us do all this<br>what they didn’t let us do was call it make me hard<br>they wanted to call it make me stiff<br>and that was like a legitimate argument<br>so you changed it<br>so we had to change it for make me hard to make me step<br>it was your choice<br>I just say<br>you’re gonna put your foot down as a creative person<br>and say no that without hard it’s not the same<br>or but that’s how dumb it is<br>when you’re dealing with network television<br>that’s how dumb their arguments are<br>it’s like everybody wants to change something<br>and they really believe<br>that they have to change something<br>to get your respect<br>that<br>you know that you’re going to have to listen to them<br>and they want to come in and they all<br>none of them are creative<br>and all that doesn’t have more offensive<br>more people<br>how could that be more offensive<br>how could the word hard be more offensive than the<br>word stiff that doesn’t even make any sense<br>stiff to me sounds like even more like<br>like pokey you know<br>like make me hard is like<br>ugh it’s like you’re rare in the girl<br>make me stiff is like<br>like you’re stabbing somebody with it like yeah<br>you know it’s like they don’t even want your dick<br>you just get a little sticky<br>that doesn’t sound fun<br>but that’s how dumb the arguments are man<br>today laser gentlemen<br>we’re learning zipperstein<br>connotative value and denotative value<br>our chauffeur educated to the masses<br>given you knowledge where’s the laptop<br>it’d be easier to read off the laptop<br>go to fucking your feet up<br>your internet and it’s so weak<br>but that will be fixed tomorrow<br>ladies and gentlemen we’re gonna do

live I’m gonna live my life<br>honestly if you just answer question<br>for like six months<br>be over yeah like the fuck people who’s out there<br>not like he has<br>so much money that he doesn’t have to work ever again<br>they can keep working though<br>they can keep playing golf right<br>he can totally plug off<br>but he doesn’t need the endorsement<br>crush people yeah I’ll get the endorsements back<br>he’ll get different endorsements<br>you don’t think somebody’s gonna sponsor<br>who’s winning these tournaments<br>yeah who do they keep showing on Sunday<br>most of the time<br>yeah let’s put our fucking logo on his bag<br>there’s a lot of money in that golf huh<br>that’s a businessman sport<br>there’s so much money in big golf<br>yeah<br>it’s like no offense you get jeff oakleby as you’re me<br>guys just doesn’t carry as much weight<br>do you think people that go<br>into golf<br>thinking that you’re gonna make money off with though<br>it’s so hard<br>I think it’s the same as any sport<br>basketball boy<br>the major sports baseball baseball football<br>that you go into it going like I love playing<br>I like all star I like all pampers<br>you know I think I’m gonna go to a<br>I think I didn’t go to a big division on school<br>in the back of your head<br>you’re like I want to play pro<br>yeah I’m sure right<br>but it’s just that you know the hardest thing about<br>becoming a professional at anything<br>difficult like roll for you know<br>whatever playing football or any sport<br>it’s the saying okay<br>this is what I’m gonna do<br>because you don’t have a fucking backup plan<br>if that’s what you’re gonna do oh yeah<br>it’s the scratcher the guy just make ties gun tour<br>it’s got a cue school<br>scratch off a fucking you know<br>8th place vinish on the best buy tour or eight grand<br>you know hopefully yeah<br>this is about spiders too<br>I see some of them are for eight and eight<br>you fight three<br>fights a year getting 30min<br>brian’s having little conversations all on his own<br>someone said winning is everything<br>codyness okay<br>would you bang tigerwood’s wife right now I think no<br>because she’d be very vulnerable<br>I don’t feel feel bad about that but<br>alright would fuck the life out of it<br>hey and then consider the vulnerable part<br>I think you have a<br>poor girl<br>you know<br>she’s having a hard time right now<br>do I have to rape her or just no<br>she wants to fuck you<br>she wants to do it she wants to fuck you<br>she needs someone to hold her<br>and then as<br>she’s holding you you grab her ask and she says nothing<br>and then you just go for it<br>you just go for it<br>yeah but she doesn’t really like grab your dick<br>you grab her hand and put her in your dick<br>and she just goes with it<br>did she get<br>into it when she’s doing that sort of a little bit<br>but she feels bad<br>so the whole time look<br>sounds like a terrible light I think I’d still go<br>I would be disappointed though I was like you know what<br>yeah that would be very disappointing<br>it would leave me the great feeling<br>yeah it wouldn’t be that<br>she got really into it though and she gave it<br>say her b game yeah just a bb plus game<br>I think I’d be super pleased<br>so much more important to have a<br>chick that’s really into it it’s so important<br>yeah a hot chick that’s not into it<br>but there’s some point<br>there’s a point of diminishing returns right<br>you know like a super hot check who just lays there<br>is way better<br>that’s not as good as a<br>one step down goes crazy but it is better than<br>one step down<br>yeah a little bit yeah<br>okay at a certain point there’s like a point<br>at a certain weight<br>certain smell<br>so like okay<br>okay I’ll take the hot the chick that doesn’t move<br>but that the item into it gives you like quarter credit<br>hotness gives you full credit so<br>here’s the thing that gets me is those<br>those robot things<br>those are those dolls those are real dolls<br>would you fuck one of those<br>cuz I don’t think I would fuck one of those<br>I fuck one I fuck pillows before<br>I would definitely yeah but I would fuck<br>but I’m saying I wouldn’t invest a lot of money in time<br>I would rather jerk off and fuck that thing<br>I’ll try it out<br>I mean how could it possibly be good<br>do you think that’s good<br>I don’t know<br>I mean sometimes lotion feels better than not lotion<br>yeah but it feels weird man I’m doing this<br>there’s one thing to fantasize and masturbate<br>there’s another thing to fuck a rubber dude<br>I think it’s the same thing that’s totally different<br>the same thing I think it feels<br>right<br>it’s just an extension that’s three d versus two d<br>that same shit just gives you more texture<br>true but it’s a thing<br>it’s not your imagination with auto manipulation<br>it’s a thing you’re fucking it’s off enough<br>I disagree fucking a rubber thing and it feels good<br>and as you’re like closing your eyes and do like this<br>could feel something<br>it feels like skin like oh it just better<br>here’s my point it seems much more humiliating<br>there’s someone<br>catches you okay<br>what the fuck<br>someone catches you fucking a rubber doll<br>you feel like shit<br>I think you’re supposed to feel like shit<br>if someone catches you<br>that would be worse<br>well that’s because I think<br>you’re supposed to feel like shit for doing that<br>that’s a fucking creepy thing you’re doing<br>you fucking a rubber doll<br>you weirdo you should just jerk off<br>now we’re gonna make chili noises<br>this is the chili noises portion of the program<br>all right let’s dumb them<br>this guy says about real dolls<br>dave broomfield says they look awesome talking<br>taking them to dinner is awkward though<br>did you ever see that maybe lars and the real doll<br>no<br>this coming is ridiculous<br>you know if you were somebody it<br>never got laid like ever<br>oh yeah<br>by the way did you guys watch that conveyor of love<br>that show no<br>oh that’s great what is that<br>it’s a new reality show<br>we’re like four hot chicks just have<br>a conveyor belt in front of them<br>and they just send guys down<br>the guy has like 20 seconds to impress them<br>or they just go get out of here<br>and it gives the hop on the conveyor belt<br>and then at the end of like 100 guys<br>then they take them on a date<br>and so then like there was a meeting<br>there’s one chicks like oh I just want that guy<br>I just want to do him so bad<br>I was like a guy who no shirt on in a puppy<br>and then the next person<br>would be like a stand up comic<br>like<br>do you like fire and he had like a fireball coming is<br>right after<br>brilliant the bachelor<br>whatever<br>the bachelor was right after the matches is that a b<br>c a b c<br>and so what do they choose like four to 10<br>like well yes no<br>no conveyor of love<br>and then all the people<br>they choose to go on day to them later<br>yeah<br>and then the dates were awful like this one guy’s like<br>crazy oh you guys got a download how incredible is that<br>one shit got stuck with this fat guy that had really<br>ugly hair by mistake because it’s a game<br>you could steal other people<br>oh no<br>if there’s two girls that want the guy<br>and the guy has to decide<br>between the two girls and they’re just<br>blunt like this might be the greatest show of all<br>time oh it’s great<br>it’s so bad it’s just like<br>let’s<br>see how much more we can let people demean themselves<br>right do you remember that show<br>temptation island do you remember that<br>that shit was hilarious<br>that was good too how crazy was that<br>they would take<br>these fucking checks and tell them to try<br>to get these

security arguing<br>that’s like the chem trail crop trails argument<br>just tell you something else and you’re like okay<br>yeah that’s right man<br>I watched a documentary last<br>night on ancient aliens on the history channel<br>I ordered on dvd<br>eddie bravo is just always<br>constantly talking about aliens ancient aliens<br>it’s like there’s there comes a certain point in time<br>where but someone is so obsessed with aliens<br>you run the risk of<br>why don’t you marry an alien<br>yeah you run the risk of like<br>not wanting to even consider aliens anymore you want<br>unless it’s not real it’s not possible<br>it’s so possible it’s possible<br>you know it’s more possible when you watch these videos<br>these ancient alien videos where they talk about these<br>ancient structures and<br>you know what technology put these together<br>I think if you just look around<br>at the evidence<br>there’s not that much evidence that aliens have landed<br>but there’s a lot of evidence that life<br>on this planet has been fucking<br>seriously jacked at least three or four times<br>like big ones that we know about mass extinctions<br>you know that’s just mass extinctions<br>what happened<br>does the call coming from inside the house<br>jeff susan management this is my management<br>they don’t even know that I’m fucking on a podcast<br>I would think that<br>jeff susan management would be aware of<br>my podcasting from three to five<br>on u stream today<br>it started 30<br>shandra<br>well<br>that’s the best way we’re all gonna be<br>become one on Twitter<br>I’m on

gentlemen<br>what am I gonna educate dana and zufa on copyright<br>well<br>I<br>am a retard I’m not educating anybody on anything<br>but copyright yeah what a copyright law I think<br>is threatening to sue<br>all these people to take illegal downloads of<br>the ufc well that’s just the right thing<br>yeah yeah they’re just talking about<br>well they’re talking about putting people in jail yeah<br>and the thread of that is enough to get<br>mostly they’re gonna<br>make some examples and stuff<br>they’re gonna throw some people in<br>that’s what the la guys said about hot stores the la<br>sheriff whatever<br>they’re like<br>you’re gonna shut down all night hundred it goes<br>won’t have to<br>shut down a few<br>don’t close yeah he’s right too<br>yeah he’s gonna risk going to jail<br>yeah he’s going down the block it’s like oh<br>there’s a dude that it was in eddie school that was<br>selling<br>he was all licensed and legal and everything like that<br>but he decided it was too risky it did<br>and it’s like you think it’s like no bamba won’t eh<br>it’s not you never know there’s a lot of people<br>you never know how to interpret them all<br>you know the interesting thing is it’s moving along<br>there’s a Tuesday to 12<br>there’s some vote in California<br>it’s on the message board where they’re talking about<br>trying to vote to move towards legalizing it<br>I’m not a register voter<br>oh you gotta register<br>you gotta participate in the fake game<br>after obama I swear to god<br>I thought before<br>obama was an office I was like you know what<br>this is gonna be very different<br>we have a black eye<br>he’s a liberal<br>I’m like the very least<br>it’ll be good for the consciousness of the country<br>they’ll have a leader<br>they’ll have someone to look up to<br>that’s more peaceful and<br>has their their shit together<br>more can speak better and is black<br>and has been through a rough child than everything<br>but he’s doing the same shit that they all do<br>it’s doing the same exact shit<br>it’s almost like they have all these ideas and they get<br>into office may realize<br>oh it’s not it’s easy to<br>make it happen<br>but it’s not just naturally you guys majority<br>you have to go along with things<br>like sending the troops to afghanistan<br>in his extra 30,000 yeah<br>well<br>at some points that he realized what choice do I have<br>I can’t just pull everybody out<br>make it a huge vacuum and just have to destroy itself<br>that’s true can’t just leave<br>yeah and then he realized I can make this proud woman<br>it’s way past the year<br>fuck you know<br>well not way past<br>but if there’s any mortres but they talk about how<br>it would become a hotbed for terrorists if we left<br>it’s a hotbed<br>now it’s the<br>whole middle east just mad at us<br>that whole middle east is mad at us and it’s like now<br>it’s like once you start bullying someone<br>and you start pushing them<br>once they go down<br>you gotta keep pushing them<br>you know that’s what’s going on right now<br>you gotta keep them down<br>no fuck you gotta keep them down<br>because if they rise up<br>and they over get something to eat<br>and they take an app<br>and they come back refresh<br>they’re gonna punch you in the fucking face<br>you know you’re gonna walk out of a restaurant<br>that guy’s gonna go right there<br>hey<br>I want to talk about what we had to talk about earlier<br>heard this thing at mpr<br>the people that have been released now and sent to<br>Yemen yeah<br>and they’re worried<br>about them you know reintegrated and they said<br>the problem is no one will give them jobs<br>they aren’t cause they’re like this whatever<br>and they’re becoming disillusioned<br>and leaning on people like akada and san yovo<br>but help me it’s like there’s newly being recruited<br>like maybe they were on the account before<br>but it’s like<br>so it’s like their life is such shit after<br>they could have gone in the right direction they don’t<br>they just become angry and well because<br>I can’t get a job<br>I’m fucking wasted eight years of my life<br>what am I supposed to do<br>you know someone else is off your<br>jobs and telling all this stuff<br>it sounds right good<br>what a martyr here can’t place to live<br>could you fucking imagine<br>could you imagine<br>how lucky you are that you<br>weren’t born in the middle of a war zone<br>I bet in place like that<br>simpsons only comes on like once a day instead of<br>what what it was it must it like<br>to be<br>pregnant to be a pregnant woman living in afghanistan<br>how crazy must that be<br>the feeling of vulnerability<br>the constant stress and shaking<br>I mean that would be just absolutely horrifying<br>morning sickness<br>Tuesday January 12<br>members of California that’s what they always do dude<br>California assembly will hold the historic vote on<br>statewide marimona policy<br>members of the<br>public safety committee will decide on assembly build<br>390 the marijuana control<br>regulation and education act<br>which seeks to regulate and control the production<br>distribution and personal use of marijuana for adults<br>the problem all these things are just wide open<br>so it’s really open to interpretation<br>you know no cash ails no it’s like what happens<br>and then they really want to narrow it down now<br>well if they what’s legal what’s not legal<br>and if they did open it up legally statewide<br>it wouldn’t be much different<br>it’s very easy to get a recommendation<br>the recommendations of the problem<br>the taxes was selling the pot<br>well there’s always gonna be<br>that’s why they’re shut down<br>not people not doctors giving up<br>yeah but with these guys<br>what they’re saying is they’re trying to legalize it<br>this is not about medical<br>this is about legalization for personal use<br>this is a totally different situation<br>they’re talking about taxing it<br>and trying to make money out of it<br>just to regulate<br>what seems to regulate and control the production<br>distribution and person use the marriage<br>yeah it’s not medical<br>they’re not talking about medical marijuana<br>federally medical marijuana doesn’t exist<br>and that’s that’s what fucks you<br>that’s what happened at top decormic<br>when he got arrested<br>he got to court and in court<br>they told him that you can’t even<br>use the term medical marijuana<br>how wacky is that<br>you can’t even say it<br>you can’t even say where you selling marijuana<br>and you go yes I was

eventually<br>everyone’s gonna have their own reality show<br>that’s my vision of the apocalypse is it<br>we all have a China<br>we’ll all have a channel<br>I mean basically that’s what we’re doing right now<br>well once you get the internet<br>you could have like up to six co hosts<br>where anyone could have their I think<br>have their face on the side<br>and you could just mute them<br>but if you want to ask him a question<br>and you join him in on the conversation<br>oh I like but we’re waiting on your internet<br>oh shit<br>so we could have like an interview like<br>mayhem and something<br>oh that would be beautiful<br>you could have a bunch of people in it<br>we have a bunch of windows<br>and they could all open up the different windows right<br>and they could be washing all the same time<br>we could move it like like<br>Hollywood squares right we’ll go there<br>go to whoopee goldberg right whoopee<br>you also put desktop like overlaid on this camp<br>we want to see the show<br>things things are going crazy<br>pretty cool right<br>nice thing about<br>10 years ago you couldn’t even do something like this<br>yeah<br>there was nothing<br>there was no Twitter there was no<br>the webcam shows were just blurry<br>pictures of fucked up girls showing you their pussy<br>and you had to be in their membership<br>to get that right<br>slow<br>right<br>those bitches went out of business with the internet<br>they blossomed<br>those cam girls<br>but then that shit just rotted on the vine<br>I miss that though because you remember<br>when you used to have like<br>that one cam girl<br>it would be like<br>a whole group of people that were all<br>just like look at this<br>she’s gonna you know<br>you know what was really cool is that crazy amber check<br>she was really cool it’s just a sex taste<br>there’s a modern day like<br>well this this chick would do real porns<br>her and her boyfriend do<br>porns and put it on the internet<br>she didn’t give a fuck<br>I followed this one<br>where it was a grilled<br>that just had her camera on 24h a day<br>and was just her and her husband living in New York<br>but they would have fucking straight off<br>when they had sex<br>they would have sex right on the camera<br>other than that it was just been living their life<br>24h a day holy shit and now she<br>gotta stop that and now she’s a successful author<br>and she’s trying to erase her past you know<br>someone knows oh really<br>did anybody save the video of her and her husband<br>fucking I don’t know but google cash is wonders<br>and I’m not gonna say her name now because<br>would you say cash wonders google cash<br>google cash if you go to google and type in internet<br>history right<br>there’s a thing that comes up<br>call the wayback machine<br>you could type in your website<br>and see what it looked like<br>back in like nineteen eighty four<br>incredible yeah<br>google is fucking<br>we were just talking about this me and<br>my tech friend that<br>wires my house<br>he was like google is like they have so much power<br>it’s almost like<br>if google were evil<br>like we wouldn’t even see them coming<br>and they document everything<br>you know<br>like if there’s an artificial intelligence out there<br>it’s google you know google is a weird company man<br>I mean they’re so powerful<br>if they do my mater they do mail<br>they do searching<br>they do your fucking maps<br>they do what your house looks like from space<br>I think longitude is the scariest one the one where it<br>just try where you are throughout the whole day<br>so you could look at it and see like oh I was here here<br>here the whole day and it records that information<br>puts it in some kind of<br>day at a base to see where people are going<br>you know that’s like fuck<br>that’s fucking crazy that you would ever<br>sign up for that too<br>it’s fucking crazy man<br>the whole google thing that you know<br>they seem like a nice company<br>and<br>that’s why gps on the google phone is kind of scary<br>because if you use google<br>what is google doing with that information<br>because there’s a way for them to use that information<br>if you’re using your<br>g maps you know right<br>and talk about where people are going<br>and when they’re going right<br>it’s yeah my theory<br>you’re running it through google<br>now you’re running your gps through google<br>you know what’s really cute though<br>what if they were evil<br>and they decided<br>well let’s just give it<br>have a lovable name like google<br>colorful we work really hard on image work<br>really hard on being green and<br>eco conscious and we really pay our employees well<br>they’re all swell but they’re just ruthless monsters<br>what if it’s the government<br>what if it is to go that’s like area 57 branch<br>no shit what if they like developed<br>they figured the way to not boycott<br>google because of these idiots<br>what if they sat down<br>what if they sat down<br>and looked at the trends that humanity is<br>participating<br>and like look where things are going<br>technologically and said you know what<br>and they got the best scientists on it<br>and they said this is<br>where we think things are going<br>we think things are going to<br>an online based email service<br>so you can access it from multiple ports<br>we think things are going to<br>and they just started listing all these things in<br>google’s okay<br>we what if it’s people from the future<br>making sure we’re going along the right path<br>what if Mr<br>Geez was trying to save us the whole time yeah<br>and he was just like this<br>butler trying to be our friend<br>it was like fuck you Mr jeeves bitch<br>I’m going I’ll talk to the hell<br>I have

I was like<br>but maybe in the night just tune out yeah<br>but maybe it doesn’t mean anything<br>well the problem is if it was really<br>but maybe I’ll have that conversation with you<br>you know if you say<br>maybe the government you know<br>really arranged that building to be blown up or maybe<br>bears arranged it<br>but but you know<br>when someone says maybe<br>but the problem is they don’t say that they go<br>maybe the government doesn’t give a fuck<br>about you and they plotted this<br>and they’re attached to that idea<br>they don’t know if it happened<br>there’s information that’s not even saying it<br>it’s like fucking do you believe that because you<br>sound like you do quit saying maybe<br>yeah yeah I think they did this<br>yeah but yeah<br>I think they just know<br>that that’s a ridiculous argument<br>it’s too hot nobody knows what the fuck happened<br>but the idea<br>that it was some gigantic fucking conspiracy that<br>thousands and thousands of people you know<br>I’m not sure that<br>a few people<br>didn’t know that something was gonna happen<br>but the idea that this many people had to be together<br>and put what the fuck are you doing<br>I don’t know my phone just started playing music<br>your phone’s gay as fuck man<br>what’s wrong was it<br>I’m not gonna even say was it a lily allen huh<br>what was that oh that’s what it was gonna learn<br>wasn’t a lot yeah yeah well what song was it<br>no I don’t talk about it just tell me a song<br>I didn’t download it all right it was awesome lady gaga<br>oh my god is embarrassing<br>did you hear carmen like it carmen do you like it<br>no perry oaking lady gaga I grow funning on there<br>why did your girl put lady gaga on your feet because my<br>phone connects to my cars when we’re going to the car<br>it’s like

like<br>lady gaga that’s fine<br>you like lady gaga<br>whatever<br>I appreciate because she<br>actually knows how to play her instruments<br>and she doesn’t lipstick<br>she’s a real musician<br>oh there he goes<br>lady gaga oh my god<br>all that her mathrodite talks just like it’s just more<br>playing it up for the media<br>very interesting<br>very interesting how people bite into that<br>that one song though gives me fucking brain captain<br>garface<br>staring cartman saying that was so fantastic<br>it’s my mind I don’t see realized<br>they did a blond touch to it later too<br>and you actually could hear the words when he says it<br>so it’s like this is ridiculous<br>there’s never been a better<br>tv show than south park consists of<br>funny consistently irreverent consistently brilliant<br>it’s so great<br>they get away with shit that no one can get away with<br>that whore off<br>when that gay dude stuffed parasilton was asshole<br>for helper<br>that’s the greatest moment of television history<br>as far as I’m concerned<br>the fact that they even got away with that<br>the fact that they went there<br>that’s where you go<br>if you’re gonna go crazy you want to go crazy<br>that’s where you go<br>and then at the end<br>he shoves her up his ass and wins the contest<br>fuck man can we really put that on tv you know<br>but because of these<br>blocky cartoons they got away with it<br>and because comedy central knows that they’re monsters<br>they’re just unstoppable<br>people wanna walk from<br>I don’t think<br>common central gets to tell them what to do at all<br>I think well yeah I think there’s a lot of that<br>I think the digits like shut the fuck<br>I think it’s probably<br>exceed if it does not really cover<br>yeah cable it’s just them sign<br>we figure the appetites might pull away<br>but the appetites aren’t gonna pull away from<br>south park they’re branding themselves to this thing<br>so everyone<br>goes knows okay it might be something like those<br>they have<br>movie success behind them too and that movie success<br>those two big huge films those<br>both films were giant successes<br>I don’t know if they were financially<br>but like I think they were<br>I think that team america though<br>that was one of my favorite movies ever and they hate<br>they said that was the hardest movie error<br>they would never do that ever again<br>because I’m really there time consuming man<br>that was such a great fucking genius and I believe<br>that it was really time consuming<br>it was so goddamn good<br>I got to see the puppets in her life<br>even the silliness of it when they had<br>they released the giant cats<br>it’s just kitty cats that are the same size them like<br>just close up<br>the whole thing to be black<br>kittens at the beginning of it<br>with the fucking terrorist<br>when that’s sexy<br>with the funniest sexine I might ever see before<br>that was probably<br>like the safe sex and<br>make a gun when they’re covered in rubber<br>you know<br>but it’s like there’s no funniest that was hilarious<br>that’s boning hardcores and<br>the unedited version where they drop<br>logs on each other<br>oh I did not see that they pee pees on too right yeah<br>what’s on edit wasn’t in the movie<br>no<br>they cut it from the movie otherwise it was gonna n x<br>wow pee and pooper no go<br>how about when he threw up and never stopped throwing<br>yes it was so funny<br>I remembered<br>crying laughing when I see that I couldn’t believe<br>how flying it was<br>I was like I can’t believe<br>when they did that first<br>south park movie and I was like okay<br>here we go I was like wait they’re saying oh my<br>this is a shopping<br>they did a musical<br>they were waiting for a south park movie this morning<br>they did a musical and I loved it<br>that was great and they did a great job but<br>how do you do a musical<br>that was a genius show<br>blaine Canada<br>no come on how good was that<br>how about all the canadians with their heads pop off<br>it’s just they all look different<br>they just look completely weird and different<br>their heads are totally different than reggae<br>just the fact that we accept that as a head<br>that’s what I can’t<br>I’m talking this this round is<br>this thing that’s letter be connected and<br>bobble it up and that we accept that<br>okay that’s the head there’s the head<br>that shit’s genius that shows so goddamn good<br>like I was looking at a cartoon in the day<br>the one that you gave me the barney rubble picture<br>yeah barney rubble doesn’t have eyeballs no<br>that’s crazy<br>he’s tripped out black pupils<br>but everybody else on the show had eyeballs because<br>his pupils are black<br>barney rubble no he’s all white<br>he’s all white<br>he’s got nothing I know because god damn zombie<br>what about on say he’s on acid<br>what’s that our fruity pebbles didn’t have it<br>no I think<br>well I don’t know maybe in fruity pebbles<br>I didn’t even know he was on fruity pebbles<br>I thought that was bam bam<br>and<br>it’s all pebbles right<br>I don’t remember<br>oh it’s all them on there<br>I think so awful expert in the flextones<br>my pebbles are pretty pebbles<br>but it’s just weird that you<br>just get comfortable<br>with the fact that his face looks like that<br>it’s like that this avatar movie<br>after an hour I didn’t

21 days<br>and the editing to five months<br>he thought it was like they said 10<br>it’s 12 weeks he goes<br>I’ll be<br>I’ll finish it for five to seven for five months<br>because that’s so much longer<br>because you can make a joke funny you can make a joke<br>not funny you do whatever you want through editing<br>I can’t even imagine shit<br>I hate dealing with this<br>just a music because I make my videos around music<br>but then if I pick a song that will<br>give me band off<br>YouTube and offs all these websites then and fuck so<br>then you have to like try to do with your own music<br>or make your own<br>kind of shit and then you lose the creativity part<br>because you’re like<br>working with bullshit<br>instead of working with led zeppelin you know<br>I hate it<br>I know it’s like one of martin scorsese’s best movies<br>good fellows do you remember the scene where<br>it was all falling apart for<br>what’s his face that’s all the coke we had<br>something like we had no one who was driving in the car<br>and looking at the sound<br>yeah the music was so important to all that shit<br>I mean it’s all that rolling stone shit you know<br>I mean it was like you that was<br>that made a lot to mention at the end<br>when he when he when he<br>put in when he’s picking up his mail or whatever<br>or the newspaper and they have<br>we did it my way by my subvisious word about it<br>but he was like that’s a reason<br>he does he’s not using this notch a version<br>he’s only on purpose<br>he wants the fucking yeah<br>that version of it<br>this bastardized version of the mafia<br>that he’s trying to show<br>it’s like yes it’s important<br>yeah<br>this music is so important to a good movie<br>all those<br>that’s one of the great things about like scorsese<br>you know yeah<br>francis for cold blood<br>they know how to pick the right fucking music man<br>yeah now the great guys<br>they know how to really jazz it up right<br>an iron marco did all those<br>good about the ugly<br>those rolled eyes<br>so jello and<br>you always use any or marconi or whatever’s name was<br>good<br>I wish I knew how to dj<br>I was like remix and stuff like that because you watch<br>it seems like it’s so much fun<br>and then you make your own music and that’s you know<br>in a way you know in a way yeah and<br>I just wish I could do that<br>what’s weird for us<br>every now and then a guy gets through<br>and it’s huge<br>like there’s that guy<br>I think his name is testo<br>he’s a gigantic dj<br>and these people were telling me this<br>dude was telling me that he went to a testo concert on<br>new years and it was like this big thing<br>I think he did it in south america<br>and he said it was insane<br>it was really crazy<br>yeah like more and they’re all in ecstasy<br>I mean like fucking utter craziness<br>hundred thousand people on ecstasy and this guy is<br>jamming this guy gets<br>apparently he’s like this multi million selling dj guy<br>I don’t know where they make their money<br>I guess they make their money on personal appearances<br>yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>dj sounds so good<br>when you’re in accessible nightclubs are in<br>it makes it sound like whoa<br>yeah I get it man<br>good good yeah after good<br>man ecstasy<br>I only did it once but goddamned it feel good<br>it’s just named right it<br>was like it kind of feel yeah you got it<br>it felt so good<br>but it’s scared that shit out of me the next day<br>the next day yeah<br>I never got one of those<br>I might have had shitty extra thing<br>I might have to get me some good<br>exercise and see what happens<br>but it might be my biochemical<br>I think it’s more that<br>it’s a real possible<br>yeah dj’s produced music but they produced music<br>that’s<br>like other people’s music<br>that they’re like piecing it together<br>and making it their own<br>but there is an art to it for sure<br>you know yeah sometimes the people that make the music<br>don’t see it<br>as well as someone who’s listening to the music<br>you know<br>I know that sounds crazy but it’s possible that a dj<br>could take a song that wasn’t really that good<br>and make it pretty fucking dope<br>and that’s possible<br>sometimes remixes are better than the original songs<br>you know<br>most of the time it is<br>like if you go to a party ben<br>or what’s that other dude’s girl talk<br>if you go download some of their music they take some<br>really good songs<br>man you listen to a mixed up and stuff like that<br>I actually like that better<br>yeah and like well that’s what everybody says about<br>I quit and tarantino right<br>that his themes are all stories from like other movies<br>the golden jobs<br>but he makes some fucking badass<br>you know yeah<br>that’s an interesting<br>little fine line now<br>kick Paris 7 8 9 1 we’re having a fight in here<br>this dude is telling someone to kick somebody off<br>they’re angry<br>oh Paris because Paris keeps on saying super cool<br>how much money do you suck my cock ribbons good<br>how much money do you have fella<br>you think that’s the real Paris parcel<br>do you think cities are on Twitter<br>delete this message<br>yes I want to ban the sender okay cool bam sorry bitch<br>nobody’s getting their cock sucked now<br>I was what I was gonna do is suck everybody’s cock<br>that was listening<br>but you had to go and fuck it up son<br>dude I didn’t know joey diaz was here<br>oh that’s ari<br>why are you so rude<br>why are you so rude it’s going deep now it is<br>it’s always going deep<br>remember the old ari that would smoke half a hit<br>and then like<br>in a car accident on the way<br>I remember when you used to get nervous before<br>getting too high<br>glen on stage<br>you got barbecued in vegas<br>how hard you get in vegas yes pretty high whoo<br>you kept going<br>we had a joint and usually does this the way it works<br>when you do comedy one hit<br>this would be fun this would be fun to get loose<br>two hits are like whoa<br>you’re trusting<br>trusting the universe and<br>you’re trusting your state of mind<br>we had four hits<br>we were we were fucking blitzkrieg it was like now<br>all right we’re just fucking one more<br>we were fucking blitzkrieg<br>the worst is when I was so stone<br>like my first week out here you invited me to go<br>see you at fear factor set<br>and he gave me these<br>these are like my body pops first came out<br>he’s like hey Ohio boy brian come here<br>you want this lollipop I’m like all right sure<br>and so I take it<br>and then like 10min later is that you feel anything yet<br>and I’m like no<br>and we’re like let’s take another one<br>so I took a second one<br>yes we took two of them and then in joe’s like well<br>here it’s hang out with all the<br>directors and producers in this trailer<br>I gotta go now and then it starts tripping<br>and I’m like<br>they’re like they’re boring how they’re going<br>and they’re like like<br>outside so<br>so so head on my yeah it was horses draw<br>I called you el diablo for like three months<br>you know what that’s how much I hated fear factor<br>I hated fear factor so much that I had to do it<br>that I would get barbecued<br>I would get so fucking hot<br>I would take these crazy beyond bomb<br>that was the name of the company<br>that would make them lollipops<br>I had to eat one of those before<br>I would do fear fact and I’d be<br>blitzgreek to the point<br>where I could<br>remember what I was talking about 10 seconds ago<br>and that’s how I would do a show<br>but it made it so much more interesting<br>it’s fun to watch<br>fear factor now knowing that though<br>cause like all the episodes you can tell<br>your eyes are all glazed over<br>and you’re like oh my god<br>you’re gonna eat<br>it must be so windy and energetic out there<br>the producers<br>knew it and liked that fact that I did it because<br>it made me more relaxing funnier<br>there were so many aggro douche bags on the show<br>I’m sure two of their producers they must work with<br>so many aggro dish bags over the year<br>so many<br>and if you want to be a dude you can make it live<br>miserable yeah<br>most of the people that did that show were really cool<br>they were there to have fun<br>trying to win some money<br>holy shit among tv you know some there was a few<br>got like stars<br>yeah they got douche well now they got aggressive<br>you know<br>there was some contestants that were like really<br>aggressive you know and<br>that was annoying cause they were all hyped up<br>trying to win this fucking show<br>and they would start shit with me<br>you know they’re at home in jersey practice<br>and if joe grog could test some shit<br>this is woman say to him<br>so they<br>don’t really say it but they go over anyway<br>they’re already wrapped<br>up by the time they get there I’m like hey man relax<br>I gotta help you yeah you relax<br>yeah<br>so the weed helps with that<br>the weed helps<br>nothing helps you deal with aggression better than weed<br>it does help forgive<br>sometimes people look watch it look<br>right there it’s sun<br>very nice<br>was that the vegas show last may says aduna<br>adunja a b d u and j<br>no we were talking about<br>yeah we were talking about Saturday night Friday night<br>the<br>we do the house of blues and vegas all the time<br>we also do the palms<br>and I’m gonna be doing that<br>like every couple months we’re gonna do the palms more<br>yeah I’m gonna do a while later but yeah<br>it’s a regular more of a club<br>yeah I think so<br>and if it’s similar to the other stuff and it’s like<br>do wear it set up that way yeah<br>it’s<br>the only thing I don’t like about the palms is that<br>the stage lighting is not the best<br>house blues all like really lit up<br>well but they might have fixed that by now<br>that’s not a big fix just a spotlight<br>but yeah so either way we’re gonna be in vegas a lot<br>talk about mma joe fuck<br>the mark gaiden<br>oh that’s john copenhaver<br>I wonder if that’s the real john copenhaver<br>that’s the real marketing war machine would have<br>is that the real mark gaiden oh that’s cool real john<br>copenhaver war machine wouldn’t have a fucking<br>little tweety bird next to him<br>what is up with those tweedy birds<br>a yellow and the green<br>that’s no picture they just joined or there a<br>lot of usd guys<br>war machines got a<br>picture of him looking all buff on it<br>the palms has the naked girl pick<br>on stage yes<br>that is yeah exactly when you’re on stage of the palms<br>right to your left<br>there’s a naked picture<br>there’s a picture of a girl showing her pussy<br>with the new in the new place<br>yeah she’s got a tits around<br>and she’s like showing a little bit of pubic hair<br>right on stage<br>in the new oh because the playboy night<br>yeah it’s like the playboy company club<br>yeah it’s very strange man<br>but I think we’re gonna do that<br>I think we’re gonna do that much more<br>the next one we’re doing that February<br>is there any female comics that you know of that<br>show their pussy all the time like hey look at my pussy<br>like joey shows the balls yeah like we’re like any<br>no it’ll get wet<br>that’d be awesome that’s a problem<br>god’s like awesome<br>right that’d be awesome<br>be like yeah<br>there’s nothing funny about a girl show in a pussy yeah<br>a do pulls his deck out<br>what what what<br>that’s funny yeah but if it chicks like look<br>I’m fingering myself in my cell phone<br>what happened here when you were young what happened<br>sarah silverman yeah<br>sarah silverman’s funny<br>but she wouldn’t be fun if she showed her pussy<br>she’s fun if she talks about her pussy<br>but if she showed it<br>she killed I did that k rock thing with her last year<br>there was like a<br>some k rock comedy hilarious she’s crushed god damn<br>she crushed it she’s funny man<br>doo doo doo pat and oswald too<br>yeah he’s hilarious<br>that guy’s<br>a really good writer I always seem at Starbucks<br>he’s always with his kid he’s like being Dad<br>Mr Dad and stuff with the kids fam<br>he always<br>surprises me with where he goes with his writing<br>I really like his writing<br>you know<br>his stuff is like<br>he’ll go someplace with and he’ll take a premise<br>that like you would think<br>like maybe you would like think about<br>like maybe I’ll talk about this on stage<br>and then it’s not funny enough<br>but he makes it fun<br>he actually makes the joke out of it<br>yeah<br>he beats it down and conforms it and makes it funny<br>with his writing<br>he always takes shit to a place I’m always surprised<br>come to Seattle I’m gonna come to Seattle motherfucker<br>eventually you put the county on a new place<br>is it better change it<br>I don’t know<br>not heard it’s not good again but this is a stupid way<br>to see this because these hashtag things<br>yeah<br>this is stupid<br>well because it keeps scrolling<br>and they can’t fucking read it<br>at least when you go to<br>actual Twitter it doesn’t do that<br>we go to actual Twitter you can actually<br>sit there it’s probably a way to stop it<br>yeah I’m not looking at hashtags<br>I’m just looking at that<br>that app thing now<br>I’m gonna just look at that now can we do that<br>it depends it seems like it’s what happens<br>I think what eustrim’s thinking<br>if that’s who he’s doing it<br>I think eustrim’s thinking if there’s a ton of people<br>that do the hashtag<br>then it’ll show up as a trending topic<br>you know here’s a good question<br>salvia have you ever done it<br>brian’s done salvia you have videos on<br>did you have a video already<br>I did it once<br>did you put a video up are you doing brian did<br>who was that look<br>it was super cool it was just totally tripping out<br>you’re on top of<br>houses looking at people’s lawns or something like that<br>I was on my childhood lawn<br>and I could feel<br>that reality here and the other reality<br>went like this and bent right here<br>the real reality here<br>and I was trying to like not make them overlap<br>because then I would never come back<br>I was like no no<br>I’m right which I’m not there<br>stop I’m incredible<br>I thought my face became carpet<br>and then it melted and tore off<br>and then I went down a water slide and<br>then I was like are you talking about my face<br>you talking about my face<br>how crazy is that that’s legal<br>salvia is legal<br>well some places it is<br>it’s actually turning illegal now<br>a lot of a couple places at Florida<br>yeah but there’s 50 states<br>lord how many of them are gonna make it illegal<br>I don’t know pretty fast though<br>I think they just did seven<br>states recently or something like that<br>damn this<br>this the mark gaden whoever you are this mark gaden<br>I’m gonna block you<br>you know yeah you talk too much<br>mark hayden I don’t think so it’s a fake one<br>no it’s real<br>it’s real marketing it’s real<br>just like the cheaters<br>this woman canadianlicious says<br>where they all on lollipops<br>also the contestants no<br>I got the contestants high on meth<br>because you want to have a good show<br>you want to have a good emotivated<br>group of people out there trying to compete so<br>they said it was common knowledge that the set supplied<br>no I’m making this<br>let’s have some banking this up<br>hey have you ever seen us killing<br>no one was on any drugs<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>they were on a squish style book four years ago<br>we give diet coke and you can have a water<br>if you wanted that too<br>or you could have a regular coke if you don’t give a<br>fuck<br>but no there was no no the contestants were not drugs<br>it was just me<br>I was on a little bit of weed<br>to try to get through the day<br>you’ve ever seen a pussy with gray pupic area<br>yet in real life<br>how not in real life<br>have you no really<br>not yet<br>but one day that’s all we’re gonna be seeing one day<br>you gotta be like why’d you start shaving your pussy<br>shut up oh talk about that green or grey tent<br>yeah it’s gonna always look dusty oh no<br>what is that<br>you’re gonna be able to see the ingrown hair<br>other knees and<br>downward elbows what other<br>mma rules we like to see on it<br>I don’t know you know<br>I think that should be up to a vote<br>what they should allow<br>what<br>yeah knees on the ground stuff like that<br>I think in a certain<br>there’s a certain<br>part about knees on the ground and kicks or the cage<br>you can’t get away from them in certain place<br>so that if it comes with<br>you get trapped up against cage<br>dudes are gonna take<br>damage that they wouldn’t normally take<br>whereas like if they did it in a ring<br>the thing about the ring is you can slide out of that<br>bitch yeah<br>you can get your head under it and just avoid the kick<br>yeah instead of having to stop right on it yeah<br>you can’t get trapped there<br>I mean you kind of get trapped in the turn<br>buckle in the corner but<br>not the same it’s there’s openings all over the place<br>what about having a warning tracker on the cage<br>and you<br>can’t kick some light in the head on the ground<br>inside that warning track<br>that’s a good idea<br>that’s all there real good baseball look at you<br>just thought of that<br>that’s a real good idea<br>right there ladies and gentlemen a warning track<br>around the cage<br>where knees on the ground are not effective<br>and so what you do is you grab a guy<br>get him in a fucking hold and you pull them<br>into the middle so you can need him in the head<br>knee I’m on the ground<br>maybe yeah that would that’s actually a smart move<br>that would make it really interesting<br>no gravity it’ll have more strategies<br>we’re trying to go to that warning track<br>I think people kind of be excited about that too<br>you know like they’re near the knee<br>near the the knee area<br>yeah people touch the middle<br>it’s like oh shit it’s in the middle<br>what’s it gonna do<br>he can’t go anywhere he’s gonna be in there<br>yeah and people talk shit<br>while he was real smart he stayed away from<br>the knee area<br>I was gonna fuck him up in that knee area<br>who scared my strength<br>so you didn’t wanna bang with me<br>you didn’t wanna bang with me I don’t know<br>fucking said he wanted to fight<br>yeah<br>doo doo doo doo<br>this guy says in the past he broadcast with<br>ufc with guest announcers<br>you find that limits your broadcasting<br>or messes with chemistry<br>no no you know those guys were nice guys<br>I did it once with craig hummer and once with<br>matt vasquergen<br>they’re both nice guys<br>very personal you know but<br>goldberg’s my you know he’s a good buddy<br>we’re friends<br>we’re real good friends so I like ham and him around<br>it’s fun and I think he’s excellent what he does<br>that shit’s very hard<br>did I ever see bill hicks live b frederick 30 ass<br>I’m a couple of times a while<br>some in la when<br>he was just<br>like just starting to be known<br>it was fun I saw a clear room I saw him bomb<br>he went up after<br>this really hacky guy and the guy was<br>doing all these<br>impressions of different<br>cartoon characters smoking weed<br>and it was just<br>he’s a nice guy<br>but it was just really hacky stuff<br>when the audience was eaten up<br>and hicks went on afterwards with all this<br>george bush war<br>john davidson<br>coming out of oprah winfrey’s ass<br>when oprah winfrey’s on the toy<br>no wasn’t an oprah winfrey who was it<br>he would do it with a bunch of different people<br>anyway he has these crazy fucking<br>bits and social commentary and<br>the audits is getting up and giant chunks<br>they were getting up like<br>10 15 people on time they left<br>they abandoned them and he was just eaten and on<br>stage but<br>we were loving it<br>it was like me and maybe like<br>seven or eight other comics what<br>he was bombing better than I’d ever seen anybody bomb<br>he was bombing like a champion<br>like you didn’t give a fuck<br>he’s taking a shit right he’s doing this bit where<br>I don’t remember who the he did want<br>sometimes you used to do it with with oprah winfrey<br>I don’t think that was oprah this time<br>but it was like that<br>that<br>she shits out john davidson<br>so I forget how the bit goes<br>but it was a really funny bit<br>john davidson was the host of that’s incredible<br>yeah what’s that<br>well maybe it was the devil fucked john davidson<br>so anyway she’s in the middle<br>he’s in the middle of squatting down on stage<br>just making these<br>moaning noises are just taking a shit<br>and he’s doing it for like a minute<br>like he’s like yeah<br>he looks up he goes<br>yeah that usually clears row<br>and then he goes back to it and he did it<br>like without any<br>there was no feeling that he was self conscious<br>it was like the feeling like yeah I’m bombing fuck it<br>it wasn’t like holy shit I’m bombing it was<br>like he was making fun of it and it was awesome<br>it was it was really really interesting to watch<br>it was like the best I’d ever seen anybody bomb<br>but we like I said we laughed our asses off<br>and I seen him kill too<br>I saw him kill a couple times<br>out of the common connection<br>with all his<br>jimmy hendricks<br>when debbie gibson was famous<br>jimmy hendricks<br>running into debbie gibson at the malls<br>really yeah I was really loud and it was funny stuff<br>he was a lot like<br>sam kenniston<br>a lot like innocent like you could tell like that they<br>work together<br>you know<br>and dudes work together as much as we try not to<br>we pick up a little piece of each other styles<br>yeah yeah totally and it’s part of it it’s like<br>I don’t know it’s like<br>we all say powerful right you know<br>why do we so why do we all say powerful<br>because my friend larry because larry said power<br>larry was the original powerful<br>so you got to give credit to the original powerful<br>but everybody says powerful<br>yeah it’s out there too much<br>yeah it’s like it’s out there<br>it’s nobody’s now<br>never know what’s like any meant to it<br>they’re all yeah<br>exactly you get it<br>it’s not like people are gonna say that<br>yeah like you can’t exactly rad as a perfect example<br>anything like that<br>there’s like something that’s hot<br>it just becomes a part of the vernacular huge<br>huge all that shit dude it’s huge and<br>when that happens<br>but that’s the original powerful is larry<br>but anyway my point is that bill hicks<br>and kennyson I don’t know who which came first<br>the chicken of the egg<br>you know I don’t know who was influencing who<br>I know kenniston was the godfather common in Houston<br>he was the guy that made everybody want to do comedy<br>he was the guy that was<br>the leader of outlaws<br>and hicks was clearly like his underling<br>but if you look at like<br>the writing<br>like hicks as writing was so much different<br>mm hmm you know they were so different<br>you know when they<br>they they both developed into their own thing<br>yeah you know hicks always had to like say something<br>whereas kenniston was just fucking we’re here for fun<br>we’re here to party we’re here for chaos<br>you know you got it with kenniston anyway<br>you got us to take<br>yeah<br>definitely he’d got to say it I did it with jokes yeah<br>like I think that’s it<br>life keeps fucking you in the ass yeah dad<br>oh it was like wow you can’t say better<br>how you really feel about life<br>can’t say better<br>that was an awesome one<br>and the one<br>on the starving children in those commercials<br>come on that’s one of the greatest comedy<br>bits in the history of the universe<br>when he’s doing that bit about those kids<br>starving like<br>what you want me to feed him why don’t you feed him<br>you’re right fucking there<br>you know that it’s like don’t feed him<br>shannon people like me<br>seven people that are gonna go there and tell you<br>that we wouldn’t have to come here<br>5000 miles with your food<br>a few people live with the photos yeah<br>you live in a desert<br>there’s no witchel’s thoughts in the desert<br>come here come here motherfucker<br>you know what this is<br>that sand<br>it’s gonna be 1000 years now<br>fucking sand we got deserts in america too<br>we just don’t live in them asshole<br>and you go god damn<br>I mean when I first saw that I was like<br>that’s the greatest<br>comedy I’ve ever seen ever<br>this is completely not caring<br>just didn’t give a fuck and there was no one like it<br>because I grew up in<br>like<br>when I first heard kenniston I was living in the really<br>conservative Boston<br>really religious<br>everyone was either catholic or jewish<br>very conservative<br>a lot of angry people but also very conservative<br>you never heard shit like that<br>nothing you never heard<br>people have the balls to talk like that<br>even when your friends are<br>around you’re all by yourselves<br>you don’t have the balls to talk that crazy<br>so to hear someone like that you’re like whoa<br>he changed comedy<br>he’s one of those guys who came along a change comedy<br>there was nobody like that before him<br>he was a total original<br>sort of that young comedian special you see<br>inside it was on it a couple other guys<br>but nelson or whatever sky thing was<br>and it was like uh whatever<br>that’s that type of kind of you see him come on<br>you’re like oh<br>it’s all gonna read that from now on like this<br>it’s all<br>they were all killed anymore yeah they were fine<br>they were all good but he was just so raw<br>so much energy yeah so much power<br>and what he was saying made so much is all so real<br>yeah it wasn’t like hey this is<br>it was the same one who bob nelson<br>was everything in bob nelson yeah<br>and he put balloons in his ear<br>it’s my impression of a football player and he runs<br>and it’s like alright that’s the thing you did but<br>it’s not you I don’t yeah<br>it’s not it wasn’t this good<br>when

own way<br>comedy is just a nutty fucking art form man<br>everybody’s got a different way of doing it<br>and everywhere it works<br>you know like<br>if mitch hedberg was trying to do his act<br>like kinnison<br>that would be crazy<br>but if kinnison was trying to do his act<br>like mitch hedberg<br>like what<br>I wonder if there’s any<br>footage of old old<br>old old bitch I’ve ever read when he

guy video<br>yeah that’s incredible<br>dan whitney yeah<br>that god larry the cable guy<br>is the most successful<br>stand up comedian in the history of the world<br>no one’s even close<br>as far as live gate sales<br>he sells out like football arenas man really<br>football arenas like 50,000 people<br>josh wolf opens for him<br>yeah it does<br>they get on a giant stage in a fucking football arena<br>dude that’s crazy<br>he had pictures of it on his phone<br>he was showing no pictures<br>he’s like look<br>man this is the audience<br>you look at you<br>what the fuck yeah that’s like a world<br>you’re doing it for like you’re doing like a country<br>how do you connect with all those fucking peters<br>all your jokes slowly<br>I don’t know man<br>do you think you could connect with all those people<br>I don’t know no man you’d have to be a powerful<br>charismatic motherfucker<br>they would have to really like you too<br>to connect with all these people<br>patients are so far back<br>it’s true the only thing is<br>that they would have to have some big ass screen<br>yeah I’m sure they’ll have that<br>but football arenas are primarily their outdoor things<br>right uh huh<br>they’re they’re never covered right they’re covered<br>sometimes they heated sometimes sometimes<br>they’re heated<br>there’s like a mini apple this is the metrodome<br>super dough whatever it is<br>it’s like 30 blow zero<br>no they can have outside like green bay have outside<br>they have to test 30 below zero<br>they people go to the game never cancel football games<br>god damn that’s crazy<br>football games are motherfuckers<br>man when you see those two<br>floor that one fan no shirt on<br>pick it up<br>nuts man yeah there’s something cool about that<br>there’s something<br>if you want to talk<br>about a sport that really does represent america<br>that represents america<br>that’s a crazy ass fucking sport<br>they will play even if it’s pouring rain<br>no rain out there<br>boba soon this is not good<br>tough shit yeah<br>like<br>in some countries they have to deal with inclement<br>whether so much<br>you know some places have to deal with something<br>we don’t have to nothing<br>in California baseball it’s like it’s raining<br>let’s yeah it’s 73 degrees it’s not incredible I can’t<br>I’m not incredible<br>I could take one of your plans like yeah<br>it’ll be harder<br>they’re not even hitting each other with anything<br>you know those guys are snowed in<br>and they’re running into each other<br>full clip in the fucking freezing cold<br>you remember<br>like when you were a little kid you would fall<br>when it was cold out<br>it would hurt so much more<br>well<br>catching a football on the cold somebody grips eating<br>oh fuck it hurts so bad I mean how cold<br>how much does it hurt when you get<br>clipped by a fucking<br>gigantic throw at a pound mine though<br>yeah<br>god that must be so painful<br>do you think we reached the end of this program<br>let’s go eat something<br>turn it club I think this is about the end<br>we’ve determined that at 2h in<br>we usually start getting boring<br>holy shit and ari archer figure got them munchies<br>holo bike<br>we didn’t take that many questions but<br>hopefully we were entertaining to<br>bitches but sometimes the questions helped us go on to<br>yes yes definitely<br>well<br>if it wasn’t for you guys we couldn’t have done this<br>obviously what did we do we just talked<br>oh and eddie they’ll tell you a call<br>they deal with a little while and they’ll go off<br>until they ready for another caller<br>you know they’ll just keep going<br>well<br>we’ve been looking for something like this for a long<br>time we’ve been looking for something like this<br>like to do some sort of a radio show<br>and I’ve talked about it like hey maybe<br>you know we could all do like<br>death squad radio or something like that<br>but really what I realized<br>is that the best way to do it is to do it like this<br>do it on the internet and we’ll<br>have this thing evolve<br>turn this room into like<br>a real like setup where you can sit down and watch us<br>yeah and we’re gonna have<br>laptop setup so that we can play videos like<br>you know like<br>hey there’s a you know<br>some crazy new fucking animal attack video<br>can we figure out a way<br>so that when we do play a video<br>just plug it in and then the screen goes to that video<br>no no<br>next week we’re gonna have it completely different<br>next week is when we’re gonna have all that<br>all that stuff<br>like video and video<br>we could have like three people talking at once<br>we’re just he’s gonna have his internet and yeah done<br>you know it’s done next week<br>you just have to change the router next week show<br>have a bunch of<br>fun shit yeah<br>what we’re gonna do is<br>we’re gonna keep doing this every week<br>and we’re gonna<br>it’s gonna expand<br>and eventually<br>I think eventually the internet is gonna<br>make its way into your car<br>that’s what I think is gonna happen<br>I think the internet would podcast and stuff like that<br>like we aren’t making mp threes of this<br>we should have maybe we can<br>okay we’ll start making<br>mp threes and put it up as podcast<br>because there was nothing about this<br>where you needed to see us<br>so we’re gonna do<br>shit like this and then<br>we’re gonna<br>we’re just gonna do a lot more internet stuff<br>really<br>what’s really good about<br>any sort of a television show is the money a<br>and the fact that people<br>now come out to see your stand up<br>which is what we’re always trying to work on<br>you know I mean if you never seen ari ari’s<br>fucking hilarious<br>there’s a lot of dudes that are out<br>there that are headlined in these<br>big clubs that<br>in my opinion<br>they’re not as developed as oreos<br>they’re not as funny as oreos but<br>arie doesn’t have many credits<br>so it’s hard for<br>just clubs to book him<br>and then<br>they assume that people gonna come out and see him<br>you know people come out and see somebody because<br>they know<br>that guy from a movie or from a television show<br>or whatever but ours are filthy pig and he goes<br>on stage in these auditions and<br>they say whatever you do don’t talk about rape<br>so what does ari do he does<br>7min rape bits<br>which is a hilarious bit<br>but you know like the reason why<br>some dudes are funny is also the reason<br>why people don’t find out that some dudes are funny<br>we have a guy that we know<br>that’s probably one of the funniest guys ever<br>this guy brian halsman<br>and no one knows who brian halsman is<br>because he’s so crazy<br>and he should have<br>he should have hit big<br>he was the guy that he was so crazy<br>we would always go into the back of the room and watch<br>him when he was a real hatred yeah<br>and get so angry and nutty<br>and every now and then he break character<br>just and a nice guy to be around to<br>when he was hanging around at the club<br>he was always friendly and<br>you know what<br>I would love to see<br>a reality show with brody stevens and him<br>and they lived together<br>why brody was too sensitive he’d get mad<br>but wouldn’t that be great<br>no no brody stevens and brent ernst<br>no<br>no I think the ultimate brodie stevens together<br>do you think that<br>the following comedians would be worthwhile for<br>like a shit like if you look at like<br>like the kardashians<br>you have to edit me up with a kardashian<br>real real I think it would be if you<br>could get the help fucked up someone more<br>what’s the appeal of kibbing up with the kardashians<br>just that she’s got a fat ass right<br>that’s it that was a target dumb<br>yeah they’re dumb<br>is that what it is but a lot of people are dumb too<br>they don’t mind<br>well sort of you know they have some money<br>not not like Paris hilton money with lots of good asses<br>yeah but you just gotta put one on tv<br>people become famous just because of their ass<br>eveda guera chick<br>I know who she is<br>she probably doesn’t know who I am<br>I know who she is why<br>because of her ass<br>I don’t even know what her voice sounds like<br>I know her face looks like joey diaz but she’s but<br>she’s only doing ass stuff<br>she sits on she sits on me<br>you know her for what she’s doing mm hmm<br>but they’ll take<br>someone like what’s the name but okay you’re a tv star<br>now jennifer lopez<br>how about that<br>famous because of her ass<br>not really famous because of her talent but<br>recognized because of her ass<br>that’s like one celebrity everybody<br>if you talk about jennifer lopez you talk about her ass<br>there’s a lot of celebrities that have great asses<br>interfere our feet are hot<br>you’re a fucking weirdo<br>god damn it<br>what’s up with people like him feet<br>that’s a very strange thing<br>yeah very strange thing but anyway we’re always trying<br>to do something<br>fun where we could all do it together<br>and just hang out and shoot the shit because<br>we have these<br>conversations<br>sometimes we say man<br>you know this is way more fun than like<br>like a radio show<br>why don’t we do our own thing like this<br>just<br>figuring out how to get it made is always the bitch<br>that’s always<br>the hard part but<br>this is easy you know<br>now that there’s something like this we don’t have to<br>figure out shit<br>so we’ll do this<br>I think it’s a good creative outlet<br>like we have to go over<br>what we said today<br>but there was some funny shit that could have been bits<br>you know<br>because we’re just really like the idea of a 360 camera<br>360 of the whole room<br>multiple cameras<br>multiple cameras yeah multiple cameras yeah I may<br>have it set up so you can choose which camera you want<br>so if it’s multiple cameras<br>can we have it<br>so they set up to choose which camera is<br>but everyone comes off one sound fee right<br>okay good<br>that’s awesome<br>all right well that’s what we’re gonna do<br>ladies and gentlemen are four square box<br>and we’re just gonna do more of this shit<br>let you guys know what the fuck is going down<br>this Sunday night<br>ari and I are at the 930 club in Washington dc<br>and it’s always old stomping grounds<br>so if there’s any hookers out there with an itchy mouth<br>did a little nothing to do with my old stopping girl<br>I’m still willing but we’re gonna get it scratch<br>there’s nothing to do ari<br>ari’s been saying he really<br>would like a blowjob blowing the turn show in dc<br>it’s a way<br>we can honor our new president and barack obama<br>and on that note ladies and gentlemen<br>thank you very much for tuning in to our little YouTube<br>or you excuse me<br>u stream u stream show and we’ll see you next week and<br>eventually we’ll have a regular time<br>that we tried to adhere to every week<br>and it might move around a little bit<br>but for the most part it’ll be like around now<br>like Wednesday afternoon<br>possibly Tuesday if we have seven<br>if we get started more on time<br>yeah people get used like at three it’ll be on<br>you know it’ll bright</p></article><div class="post-copyright"><div class="post-copyright__author"><span class="post-copyright-meta">Author: </span><span class="post-copyright-info"><a
