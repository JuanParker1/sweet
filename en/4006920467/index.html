humans<br>they’re cousins of dolphins<br>and then we put them in a fucking fish tank<br>and make them do tricks from mackerels<br>you know<br>could you imagine what kind of hell that life is<br>then this whale had killed<br>a homeless man<br>that snuck into the fucking tank in 1991<br>and he had also<br>or it might be a she I’m not sure he or she had<br>also I think it’s a he<br>it also almost

in<br>Australia while we’re there<br>and there was a cool part of it was the crocodile cage<br>because<br>I don’t think that crocodile gives a fuck where it is<br>I think crocodiles are so dumb<br>I mean their minds seem so dead<br>they just lay there<br>with their eyes closed underwater<br>for like hours at a time<br>but they don’t have to breathe<br>they don’t have to breathe for like an hour<br>so they just lay underwater<br>and just do nothing and just sit there<br>they don’t run around and play<br>like when you pass like the monkey cage at a zoo<br>that shit’s depressing<br>because they don’t want to be there<br>when I was in Denver<br>there’s a zoo in Denver and<br>the monkey got in its fucking cage and was howling<br>this horrible howl and it wasn’t a big cage<br>this monkey was screaming out like a tortured soul<br>it was like a man in prison<br>you know let me out of here<br>the monkey was just<br>just screaming at the top of his lungs and I was like<br>you know this is not good<br>like this is not cool to do to them<br>for what so people can stare at them<br>I mean that shit<br>might have flown in the 19 thirties<br>you know back when there was no zoos are back<br>when there’s no<br>videos but we have videos now<br>man you don’t have to put them in a zoo<br>you know but<br>but that’s the only<br>time we’d ever be able to see most of those animals<br>that’s the only thing that makes me go<br>well I see that reason<br>for a zoo because I’m not going to africa<br>and hunting down a white tiger<br>you know right but is it worth it for them<br>to struggle just so you could stare at them<br>yeah but you don’t know<br>it could also be like dude wait<br>I don’t have to hunt my food<br>there’s just a stake here every morning when I wake up<br>I could sleep<br>no you know no for like tigers<br>that shit is orgasmic to chase down an animal<br>chase it move it<br>you ever see a cat<br>like if you roll a ball string in front of them<br>they can’t help themselves<br>man you should know now you have cats right<br>cats can’t help it<br>they live for chasing shit<br>it’s just like like you know<br>a guy with a hard deck lives to fuck<br>you know it’s really the same thing man there<br>it’s nature rewards<br>them for being a good predator and I think<br>you know the same way<br>food tastes good for us and sex feels good for us<br>they love to kill them<br>nature rewards them with some crazy rush of energy<br>and endorphins when they kill something<br>you know so you give them a coal play to meet<br>just push an aluminum tray under the fucking cage<br>that’s not the same and that’s not fun<br>guaranteed<br>you know but that doesn’t that<br>the killing thing<br>bothers me<br>but what really bothers me is the fucking amount of<br>room that they have to move around<br>the kangaroo case l<br>a zoo definite<br>the kangaroo cage was fucked up<br>have you ever into the<br>san diego zoo though that’s a whole I mean yeah<br>that’s what I was there<br>I was like man I was like to be an animal in this cage<br>oh no we went down<br>this serious fucking delay<br>between what we’re saying and what we’re saying<br>is that it we got it okay<br>yeah san diego is the shit the way they have it is nice<br>they have a big giant ass place<br>that makes sense but<br>that’s fucking expensive<br>yeah you know<br>but that’s how it should be<br>plays like la zoo just shouldn’t exist<br>because that’s just wrong<br>you go to the la zoo that’s just depressing as fuck<br>but there is zoos like the Columbus is where I’m from<br>is one of the biggest zoos<br>jack hannah’s from it<br>and it’s nice<br>they may have just<br>acres and acres and acres of land and they<br>you know I don’t know<br>if they maybe<br>throw out some goats once in a while for the tigers<br>or something they just don’t talk about it<br>no they don’t<br>do that they don’t ever do that they do that in Iraq<br>this video and Iraq of<br>they let a donkey loose and<br>this is how they do it every day<br>and the donkeys just walking around eating<br>and they open up the gate and these tigers come<br>running out of the gate and just<br>bitch slapped that<br>donkey to the ground and fucking jack him<br>it’s really kind of wild to see<br>and it’s really shocking these gis filmed it<br>when they were in Iraq at the zoo<br>it’s shocking to see but<br>that’s really the way they’re supposed to eat<br>like though that’s how you should do it<br>if you’re gonna<br>feed animals you’re gonna have wild animals<br>you should have them eat what they normal eat man<br>I mean like what’s with this<br>feeding fucking snakes<br>frozen mice give them a fucking mouse<br>you know I mean that’s what they’re supposed to do<br>we’re trying to like enforce our own ideas of<br>morality and predation on fucking monsters<br>you know I mean like look a snake is a monster dude<br>you know<br>tigers that’s a monster those are all monsters<br>yeah they’re natural monsters<br>there’s a whole natural cycle of things and<br>to take them out of that<br>there’s a there was a kangaroo cage<br>that was the most depressing thing<br>because those kangaroos would just sit in there<br>they didn’t do shit<br>they just laid them human beings though<br>it could be considered monster<br>so like if you put somebody in prison that’s a<br>mass murder we’re doing the same thing you know<br>we should let that mass murder go out on his way<br>and just murder a shitload of people<br>you know what kind of dumbass logic is that<br>well I mean if you’re saying<br>like a tiger’s a tiger or whatever<br>like a snake should kill its own prey and we should<br>you know do it<br>what well what no<br>we’re feeding them<br>killed prey we kill it first<br>that’s what’s the most ridiculous thing<br>is that we kill what they<br>eat first so that it’s not as brutal for us<br>somehow or another someone else kills it<br>you buy it killed then you feed it to them<br>that’s ridiculous<br>that’s not a mass murderer dude<br>mass murderers are just fucking the head<br>they’re not they’re not killing for food<br>it’s a part of a natural cycle they’re just nuts<br>yeah you know<br>when you get a nutty person<br>the problem is human consciousness is so more complex<br>supposedly than animal consciousness<br>because we have the ability to alter our environment<br>so you can’t have<br>someone whose consciousness is haywire<br>because that’s<br>when you have like serial killers and mass murders<br>what you have is someone whose consciousness is just<br>gone off the tracks and into the woods and you have<br>just chaos<br>if a society is aware of itself<br>it has to realize<br>that there’s certain issues you’re going to come up<br>when you have crazy people<br>running around killing your family<br>and your friends<br>so you got to kill them<br>what you’re supposed to do with<br>someone like a mass murderer<br>if you’re absolutely convinced<br>that’s the problem<br>really the problem is the court system<br>the court system so fucking corrupt and<br>so many times<br>da’s and prosecutors are just trying to get<br>they’re just kind of trying to get a guilty verdict and<br>they don’t give a fuck<br>if someone is guilty or not<br>there’s many many many instances where cops are framed<br>guys<br>that were innocent people have gone to jail for years<br>it turns out through dna evidence they were framed<br>I mean that’s happened many many minute<br>that’s the real fucking problem<br>but if we could be absolutely sure<br>that we knew that somebody was a mass murder<br>or a rapist or<br>anyone with no remorse who hurt other people<br>and could hurt someone that you care you gotta kill him<br>why keep moron there’s too many fucking people<br>you know I mean look it’s not like<br>they’re not gonna die eventually<br>anyway it’s not like if you don’t kill them<br>you know they’re gonna<br>fucking cure cancer and live forever<br>no they’re not gonna do anything<br>they’re not<br>a mass murderer is not gonna contribute to society<br>you know they’re just not<br>there’s nothing is gonna<br>nothing good is gonna come out of that<br>they should just line them up in like oh you need a new<br>liver bam you’re on death row there should be no like<br>you know<br>time period and they’re going to electrocute you<br>they should just shoot you<br>take all the parts that they need<br>they could use your corneas or that your livers<br>yeah that’s an interesting<br>topic because there was a thread on the board<br>a message board<br>on my website<br>where people are talking about organs having a memory<br>and<br>all these people who have<br>gotten transplants from people all of a sudden<br>they knew things<br>that couldn’t have possibly remains of that<br>people they don’t even know<br>but you know and stuff like that<br>yeah I mean<br>I’ve heard of<br>many things like that where people<br>all sudden had cravings for certain types of foods<br>and they had no idea<br>that the pert<br>I mean this is not just one instance<br>and see the thing is about memory<br>like we don’t know where memory is stored exactly<br>we don’t I mean they know an incredible amount<br>more than the average person<br>about the way the human body works<br>much more than people knew 100 years ago<br>much more than a<br>you know even a decade ago<br>but they don’t know everything<br>there’s a lot of questions man<br>first of all with human body<br>your cells regenerate every seven to 10 years<br>so literally every cell in your body<br>changes and becomes a new one<br>like you you’re a new version of you<br>every seven or 10 years that<br>they’re yes they’re not the same anymore<br>so if that’s the case where the fuck are your memories<br>because<br>I have memories that are way more than 7 years old<br>you know so where are the memories stored<br>if you have a completely new cell<br>mean are the memories like transferred<br>back and forth<br>between the cells when the new one is born<br>is it born with the same memories<br>I mean where’s the memory where’s it stored<br>we don’t fucking know<br>the other<br>ideas that the memories are stored in the neurons<br>well<br>if that’s the case because the neurons are the only<br>thing that stay<br>the neurons are not<br>you get<br>the neurons you get or the neurons you get forever<br>you don’t get new ones<br>they don’t regenerate every seven years<br>but the heart is filled with neurons<br>you know it’s like<br>one of the biggest clusters of neurons in the body<br>it’s like right up there with the brain<br>and I think<br>you know people who have had hard transplants<br>I don’t think it’s that preposterous<br>that they would have memories<br>I don’t think that’s is that preposterous at all<br>I think it is<br>and I think that<br>these people that say that they’re having dream stuff<br>they probably would have had that same exact dream<br>with or without it<br>why would you say that brian<br>they’re talking about<br>things that couldn’t possibly have known about<br>people have<br>this little girl gave up the exact identity<br>and location of the woman who of the man who murdered<br>the girl who gave her the heart<br>do you know that story<br>no but it started the same spring fetch<br>it sounds far fetched<br>but it doesn’t mean it sounds far fetched<br>there’s some things that I read that<br>when it like that that it’s kind of like to me<br>is seeing ufos<br>it’s either somebody that wants attention<br>that’s possible<br>dome and they’re going<br>no I had my arm transplant and now I can<br>I think having all these dreams of people I don’t know<br>and it’s that’s okay<br>that’s possible<br>I know I know it’s also possible<br>oh totally it’s real it’s the problem with skepticism<br>what skepticism<br>when it comes to something that we don’t understand<br>that’s the problems that you know<br>you run the possibility of a<br>excluding something because it seems irrational<br>but the reality is<br>we don’t have enough information<br>to decide what’s rational and what’s irrational<br>just the idea<br>that you have memories at all is fucking nuts<br>you know the idea that you can<br>how about the idea that you can change<br>people’s memories<br>you know they say that especially right after<br>something shocking<br>if you start talking to someone<br>and introducing new ideas to them<br>they’ll have they’ll re remember the whole situation<br>they’ll change the whole way they remember things<br>have you ever thought of something was in some way<br>and then you go back and you watch the video you’re<br>like god damn it wasn’t like that at all<br>like I had a fucking<br>I don’t trust my memory that much<br>I trust some things<br>there’s some things that I know<br>that are recorded in there forever for real<br>and no doubt about it<br>there’s some things<br>because I’ve made sure that I’ve kept that memory<br>like I’ve had some<br>pretty intense experiences where I made sure<br>like I am going to make<br>sure that I record this one right<br>but other ones are a fucking blur<br>man you know there’s a lot of them that are blurry<br>you know you look back on your<br>your high school years like jesus christ<br>it’s like a slide shows and<br>I barely remember any of it do you remember<br>it’s getting worse and worse<br>I’m actually pretty good with a lot of weird memories<br>but<br>then I the other day I was trying to think of somebody<br>and that I actually<br>hung out with for three years when I was a kid<br>and don’t remember his face at all<br>came and put like my sister’s like<br>you don’t remember him<br>we hung out all the time<br>like I remember him but I don’t<br>know have any idea what he looks like<br>yeah I’ve had that happening before for sure<br>that’s fucking weird it is weird<br>it’s so weird<br>I wonder where where all that shit goes up in smoke<br>why is it that someone can pull it back though<br>like someone will<br>say something like you go yes<br>and then all said boom<br>the memory like blossoms in your mind<br>like what is that it’s like<br>you’re given cpr to the memories<br>just like they’re almost dead<br>yeah it’s like a branch of the tree was hit<br>a nerve of that memory was hit and it woke up that<br>section of memory or whatever<br>yeah something along those lines what is that<br>what the fuck is that<br>it’s my thought getting tired of something<br>oh dude you got a spider on your face look oh shit<br>that’s a daddy wrong way<br>how the fuck did that get on me<br>what your house is a beer factor<br>oh I’m not on<br>I’m not on obi and anthony this week<br>it’s not this week they made a mistake<br>I’m there March 26 not February 26<br>it’s the Friday Friday before the ufc next month<br>I’m in Dallas this weekend<br>I’m not in New York this weekend<br>so<br>I’m gonna be at the addison improv<br>this weekend<br>Friday Saturday and Sunday with my man joey diez<br>and brian will be there as well<br>if we get brian drunk<br>we might have to talk to him in the go on stage<br>bryan is actually a funny comedian<br>he’s done stand up a couple of times he did in<br>Atlanta he did it<br>well<br>you know I was going to<br>try to go up on stage before this weekend just in case<br>if I get too drunk<br>and put me on stage<br>but I really it really hurts me to go back and<br>spend 3h of my life<br>for like 5min in front of two people<br>yeah<br>the open mic nights<br>it is a grind<br>you know people ask me questions all the time<br>like hey I’m thinking about doing comedy<br>what’s the best advice mike man<br>you got to be willing to put your whole life aside<br>you got to be willing to<br>you got to be wanting to<br>especially if you have a job during the day<br>you have a job during the day man you’re nighttime<br>you now that’s your social life<br>it’s gonna be stand up comedy<br>you’re gonna be going<br>to clubs and you’re gonna be performing<br>and you have to do it all the time<br>if you don’t do it all the time<br>you’re gonna forget all your material<br>that whatever comfort you gain on stage<br>will be eroded very quickly<br>you know it’s a goddamn long ask ride man<br>yeah I think if I was younger I would totally be<br>into it but it’s really hard to be an adult<br>and waste that much time<br>it is it is hard you know I did it<br>I started out doing stand up when I was 21<br>that’s why I did it right after my 21st birthday<br>and I was just had shit going on back there man<br>you know I mean I was doing things I had<br>you know I had<br>a life sort of<br>but it wasn’t like I had a family right<br>mortgage or you know<br>no obligations<br>yeah I’m no internet but<br>I have no obligations you know so it wasn’t<br>it’s hard<br>when you have a girlfriend and you have a life<br>and you have a wife and you have children and you have<br>mortgage fuck man<br>you know when I talk to dudes that are like 40<br>and they’re thinking about doing comedy<br>I’m like you know<br>okay dude<br>that’s like saying<br>I’m thinking about getting into brain surgery<br>man think about brain surgery<br>not saying that comedy is as hard as brain surgery<br>because first of all it’s not as<br>it’s not as difficult to remember<br>all the things you need to remember<br>with brain surgeries<br>but it’s<br>just as difficult in a way because<br>there’s no real path I mean you can suck as a comedian<br>you can’t suck as a brain surgeon<br>you’re fucking going to jail<br>so it’s obviously a lot<br>more discipline involved in<br>brain surgery because you have to do it correctly<br>but both are equally difficult to actually<br>fucking do and put anything in this life is difficult<br>if you’re gonna really do it<br>you mean just think about it if you started<br>tomorrow and you wanted to be a computer programmer<br>you don’t know<br>shit about computers<br>you just you’re starting from scratch<br>and you want to be a computer programmer<br>fuck<br>imagine the fucking work that’s involved<br>in that a lot of reading though<br>you know it’s a lot of reading nowadays<br>I mean I could pretty much teach myself<br>some programming by just looking at video<br>you know how to type you know right about computers<br>you know a lot of shade about computers<br>you know a lot of shade about code<br>you know to a person that has no experience<br>whatsoever and decides I want to take on a new career<br>I want to be a computer programmer<br>I want a code for video games<br>good fucking luck man<br>how about I want to create video game engines<br>I just I don’t know where I want to be<br>the next john carmack<br>you’re fucked man yeah you’re fucked<br>that shit will take forever<br>anything that’s worth doing<br>takes fucking forever to get good at<br>you know and comedy is no different<br>comedy music is no different<br>you know I often like look at people playing piano<br>or playing guitar or something like that<br>like how cool would that be to be able to just fucking<br>jam on the dish<br>but god damn that’s a lot of fucking time<br>I’ve tried to learn that though<br>it’s a coordination thing for me though for like that<br>that’s something I think you’re just born with<br>being able to understand<br>be able to coordinate each finger a certain way<br>well it’s also cultivation<br>it’s also if you do things like with your fingers<br>like that early on in life<br>it becomes much easier as we get older<br>they say that the army now is using<br>they’re using xbox controllers<br>for their drones<br>because these fucking kids are so good<br>yeah and they’re encouraging people to play video games<br>I mean it’s just a matter of time before they start<br>recording like the baddest motherfuckers<br>in video games like yeah they probably really do<br>yeah I mean like if you could play<br>like war games with like a keyboard and a mouse<br>like there’s these dudes that play quake<br>like professionally<br>those motherfuckers can<br>move that mouse cursor and put it on an object<br>like instantaneously<br>you know they know exactly where that cursor is going<br>they play so much<br>that when they move that mouse<br>the mouse and a keyboard is<br>way more accurate than that<br>joystick thing<br>the joystick thing is kind of difficult to manipulate<br>the like the toggles and like<br>exactly where the cross here goes<br>but if you have a mouse you can put a mouse<br>if you understand like how quick<br>you know that all depends on<br>you know everybody likes it different<br>some people like high sensitivity<br>some people like low sensitivity<br>but the bottom line is<br>once you get used to whatever it is<br>you move the mouse that<br>the cursor goes in a certain directions<br>they can put it like exactly where they want to<br>instantly so it’s not like<br>you’re in a helicopter<br>and you see the insurgents you got<br>to move the crosshairs and get them in line<br>we have them in line we have them in line<br>no it’s bang<br>I mean they could do it so fucking quick<br>I mean<br>that would be some crazy shit if you could have drones<br>and that like that guy<br>fatality you know<br>fatality is yeah yeah<br>he’s like the baddest motherfucking quake player ever<br>this dude is just<br>ridiculously accurate with his mouth<br>and a cool guy to it<br>let him very nice guy<br>but if you got that guy<br>playing for your army<br>and you have drones with missiles in it<br>from that fucking guy<br>holy shit you know yeah that’s the future man<br>welcome to the new world<br>it’s pretty crazy<br>how video games have exploded from something<br>that used to be like<br>like little ping pongs<br>now people have<br>like amazing video games on their phones<br>yeah it’s credible man<br>just look at what you can do with your iphone playing<br>you know all these different racing games and shit<br>we working on the new ufc<br>fight game right<br>fuck it’s amazing man when you watch<br>some of the graphics and shit like they<br>dive for knee bars<br>they get triangles<br>they throw head kicks and punches flying knees and shit<br>you see all this crazy shit<br>all these different techniques they can do<br>just like in real fighting and it’s like<br>it’s so close<br>to being like a video that you like an actual ufc fight<br>that you can manipulate you know<br>the limit is in the controller I think<br>what eventually’s gonna happen<br>is you’re gonna have a goddamn suit on<br>you’re gonna have a fucking suit on<br>or you’re just gonna have this little wire plugged in<br>on your forehead and you’re just gonna think<br>that could happen<br>but microsoft is very<br>close to developing the whole system<br>where you interact<br>with the gint what’s it called nutell<br>it comes out like<br>the November or it might have got push spell<br>in a t a<br>l<br>and it’s pretty much just like a<br>camera or something that sits on top of your tv<br>and then it reads your motion<br>it reads your motion<br>yeah<br>that’s incredible because that’s gonna be fucking cool<br>imagine having like a ufc game<br>where you could learn how to fight without actually<br>fighting yeah<br>but yeah my problem with that whole thing is<br>I think maybe if I was a kid I would have loved it<br>but when I’m playing a video game<br>like I don’t want to have to be doing this<br>shit you know<br>well you say that<br>you say that I’m doing it with wii right now<br>they find a wii<br>yeah but we is<br>racked this little thing<br>and you’re playing ping pong<br>and it’s sort of moves the way you want it to<br>I did a wii car<br>game once and I was like this is not specific at all<br>it’s not rewarding yeah<br>but it’s something about having to like get up<br>like I wanted you’re a lazy fuck no that’s what<br>yeah if I was a kid it might have been better<br>but like nowadays I want to play video game<br>I just want to sit there<br>right and smoke weed<br>but that’s depending on the graphics<br>what if the graphics were like three d<br>fucking super dope virtual reality type shit<br>and you had a virtual gun<br>and you’re running down a hallway shooting<br>at all because of shit<br>like you have a gun in your hand and it reads this gun<br>come on man that would be this shit<br>and the actual running that you take place like maybe<br>that would be the shit<br>if you had a fucking warehouse<br>like a virtual reality warehouse<br>like you enter into the door<br>you put on this helmet<br>and it’s just a flat ex laser tag<br>yeah but<br>complete three d virtual reality<br>you know yeah<br>and if you get close to the walls like a little<br>light goes on<br>you are getting close to the wall<br>that would be turned right you know<br>yeah yeah come on man<br>I just got into a point where I<br>did this Nintendo wii shit just drives me crazy<br>the wii is boring man<br>the wii is like playing pool<br>but there’s no pool cue yeah you’re just going like<br>and there’s no feedback<br>you need feedback man like I want to click a button<br>and see a gun go off you know<br>I want to click the mouse button and see the rocket<br>you know take off right<br>that this whole moving our arm through the air<br>that’s fucking weak<br>yeah that’s stupid<br>I forget what it was<br>they just said the other day that in the future<br>that they’re going to use like google maps<br>and like street view<br>google maps and you’re gonna be playing video<br>games of like your street<br>you’re going around in your house<br>you know what I mean<br>you should be able to find<br>out if someone is playing like fucking<br>doom on your street and brown up your house right<br>you can be like yeah<br>like hey<br>just want you to know they should send you an email<br>it should be like the sims whereas your house is<br>the house in the video game<br>and so if you try to break in your house<br>they’re trying to break in your house<br>like<br>everyone should have their own house in the video game<br>yeah that would be kind of cool<br>that would be cool right then<br>you would know where everybody lives<br>everyone lives<br>and they killed them<br>children in the video game<br>don’t really don’t have access to<br>well for like 24h or something you can run away<br>I’m kind of shocked at virtual reality<br>kind of hit like a<br>the technology<br>never really developed the way I thought it was going<br>to like you know you<br>heard about that shit like way back in the eighties<br>and I thought wow<br>like there was movies based on that<br>and I was like I thought like wow I remember like um<br>well sort of dagger<br>I don’t remember what movie remember total recall<br>they fucking make you could dream right<br>yeah that shit’s coming<br>it’s a total recall<br>what was the one with the chicken the red hair and<br>they’ve already been able to take images<br>and implant them in people’s minds<br>and they’ve been able to read images<br>from people’s minds<br>like read what you’re thinking about<br>like you can look at something<br>and the computer<br>like there’s some sort of<br>sensors that they hook up to your brain<br>and then it sends the image to a computer and it’s<br>it can tell what you’re fucking looking at<br>like that’s nuts man<br>because eventually I mean this is in very<br>rudimentary stages as a technology where they can only<br>pick out shapes and shit<br>but eventually they’re gonna be able to fucking see<br>what you’re seeing<br>yeah that’s it<br>is that what was yeah<br>check out the red hair in 5th alma<br>is that the bruce walls mos<br>yeah and they had like memories<br>like I moved to the plug like memories in your head<br>that was<br>how badass was chris tucker in that moon<br>remember he was that crazy alien<br>remember lawnmower man<br>that was a good louie too<br>there’s another nutty movie but a retard<br>that went crazy right right<br>put up computer in his brain right something<br>right yeah another steven king book<br>stephen king oh no it was strange days what is it<br>strange days was another<br>virtual reality something<br>crazy asked I think it was strange days<br>that was an awesome maybe strange days<br>this going here<br>just said that<br>I can’t wait for strange days to become true<br>that’s what it was it was strange was it<br>yeah that was the one<br>angela bassett right<br>yeah sure forever be tina turner<br>sorry you gotta love doing the other movies<br>I don’t think we thought<br>you’re tina turner<br>um what was it gonna say<br>oh this fucking missup beverly hills<br>did you hear about this<br>yeah another<br>one of these beauty pageant chicks<br>came out saying that<br>she doesn’t believe the gay should be married and she<br>you know she quoted leviticus and the old testament<br>saying that the<br>you know the bible says that<br>it’s some stupid quote like<br>any man who lays down with a man as if<br>you know the same way lays down with a woman<br>it’s an abomination should be put to death<br>so she came on and said that gay should be put to death<br>luke she’s supporting the old testament<br>which by the way I mean<br>whatever you fucking want to believe about religion<br>that’s all well good you know<br>who knows if god is real who knows I mean<br>it could be that you<br>know the bible was completely ridiculous because god<br>wants things confusing<br>who knows but it gets a certain point<br>when you read certain things you gotta go<br>all right every<br>people are full of shit<br>and there was no internet back then<br>it’s not like you know there was a copy of<br>the bible on Wikipedia and people kept altering it<br>but everybody was like nope<br>that’s not what it says<br>and they went back and changed it<br>you know they didn’t the old testament<br>they didn’t even write that fucking thing down<br>for like 1000 years<br>it was just stories<br>you know and the idea that those stories<br>you can’t tell I can’t tell a story to him<br>and he tells it to his girlfriend<br>his girlfriend writes it in her blog<br>and it’s the same story<br>it’ll be fucked up for sure<br>I can’t tell you how many times like someone has<br>gone to one of my gigs<br>I’ve said something<br>and then a guy<br>like will quote on Twitter<br>like all dude<br>that was so funny last night<br>when you said this about that<br>I’m like damn<br>I didn’t say that<br>you’re saying something fucked up<br>what I said was a lot nicer you know but when<br>when you realize like that memories are so fucking<br>there’s no way<br>there’s no way you could be that accurate<br>over 1000 years where people<br>talking about it<br>and then on top of it<br>the original the old testament bible<br>was written in ancient hebrew and to this day<br>they only know 3 out of 4 words in ancient hebrew<br>25% of the words<br>they don’t have a clues to what they mean<br>not only that<br>letters and numbers were the same thing<br>back then there were no numbers<br>so the letter a was also the No.1<br>so there was like numerical<br>value in words like the word love<br>and the word god<br>they have the same numerical value in ancient hebrew<br>but as soon as they<br>translated that to latin and to Greek<br>that shit was all gone that shit was all lost<br>for this dumb bitch<br>to sit and think that god wants people to<br>put the death of their gay like<br>miss beverly hills miss beverly<br>this is a new one<br>new miss California<br>and California’s supposed to be so liberal<br>it ain’t miss Texas<br>do you know who carrie anne pantchi is<br>or whatever name is<br>she’s from celebrity rehab beniche peniche<br>she was the one that<br>had the threesome with the guy from grey’s anatomy<br>anyways on this show celebrity rehab<br>she<br>you just want to strangle her<br>and I think it’s almost with these like pageant people<br>because I know a couple of these<br>girls that do the pageants<br>and stuff like that<br>they’re fucked up in their head<br>you know they’ve been doing it all their life<br>these little kids are grown up<br>do you remember last time<br>not last time we went to Dallas with the time before<br>when there was that little girl<br>pageant right going on at the hotel we were yes<br>you remember that shit<br>yeah that was scary<br>that was the weirdest fucking thing ever<br>we’re hanging out the hotel and there’s all these<br>little girls I mean little like six yeah<br>6 years old with high heels<br>and makeup on with their hair done and jewelry<br>and dresses<br>and you’re like what the fuck is going on here<br>that shit is an abomination<br>alright that is a fucking<br>that is a travesty<br>I feel like something<br>wrong in the elevator because I was in<br>the elevator with two of them<br>I looked at her and I’m like<br>oh my gosh you don’t really look at<br>it it’s like if they were naked<br>finger in themselves in front of you<br>like oh<br>yeah something’s not right there<br>sometimes my daughter will play with her pussy<br>just I don’t know and I won’t say this true<br>I mean you would too if you had one<br>but something<br>the other day<br>she was lying there and she had her little<br>feet up in the air<br>she’s rocking back and forth she just two hands<br>just grabs it<br>you know and I<br>I don’t know what to say<br>like what do you say to that you go<br>don’t do that you can’t tell her not to do that<br>it’s you know<br>you don’t want to suppress her and get her crazy<br>yeah we also don’t want<br>her to be like like in kindergarten going hey anybody<br>they all do it anyway dude<br>I got news for you they all do it<br>don’t you remember<br>doing weird shit with kids when you were little<br>did I play doctor<br>me and my friend play doctor with all the girls and<br>and I remember the only time I remember the most<br>we had three girls lined up and we were like okay<br>we were gonna be putting pencils in your vaginas<br>take off<br>it so it took off other pants and<br>we just went back to each one<br>then we pull it out and smell it and goes<br>dude<br>fuck but we were all like five<br>you could give those girls lead poise now<br>I know they might be retarded now because of you<br>they’re off on my Facebook too so<br>hopefully they’re not watching one<br>you should ask them all questions<br>does anybody remember anything<br>about pencils<br>you remember putting a pencil in your car<br>but<br>this<br>so this beauty pageant thing that we saw at the hotel<br>it was dark<br>I mean it was really dark because there was all these<br>weirdo fucking religious people<br>with their kids dressed like horse it made<br>no fucking sense<br>I mean no sense because they were<br>it was on we were there on a Sunday<br>and they were talking about church<br>so it was all this church talk<br>and you got your girl dressed as a fucking prostitute<br>there’s a six year old dressed as a prostitute<br>and you’re talking about church<br>they had high heels shoes on<br>I mean like this high<br>which the only reason why shoes have heels like that<br>and so that women’s legs look longer<br>so that guys think about them<br>when they’re pushing these long legs back<br>and fucking the shit out of you<br>that’s what that’s for<br>those that long leg thing<br>why do you think what do you think that’s there for<br>you’re sacrificing how you can walk<br>how about that<br>just so that men want to fuck you more<br>than we already do<br>which is<br>wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait<br>you have sex with<br>girl that has her shoes on like high heels<br>have you ever got that<br>no<br>what is up with that though that’s just porno stuff<br>that’s ridiculous<br>I mean I’m sure it somewhere in my life<br>you know somewhere I was not you know<br>taking everything off<br>that’s it’s possible but<br>that someone would like that<br>but the whole I don’t like them in the first place<br>I think they’re ugly and<br>it seems to me like you’re doing something stupid right<br>you know I don’t want to be like<br>you’re getting tricked<br>you don’t need to do it for me you know<br>like my wife always wants to wear<br>these high heels when she leaves the house<br>like okay<br>if you want to do that that’s all good but to me it<br>seems like you can’t walk right<br>I rather you wear tennis shoes but women love them<br>man they love shoes<br>they love how they look they love<br>it’s like how dudes love cars<br>you know how you know like you see like a 69<br>mustang or something like that<br>and you go whoa<br>and you like pull up to a dude<br>look at that motherfucker you know<br>I’m saying like there’s something<br>that men have<br>like women can go wow that’s a pretty car<br>but it’s not the same as how a dude looks at a car<br>well for girls<br>the shoe thing is just<br>they really fucking love shoes man<br>they’re like makeup and shoes<br>it looks like they’re<br>opposite sides of the body<br>because they’re so ashamed of the middle<br>thank you bleed that’s gross don’t look at it<br>look it up here<br>my eyes are huge look at my lashes<br>they’re unnaturally long<br>yeah right<br>it’s probably something like I legs just so long<br>do amazing look how long my legs are<br>and where do they go to look up there<br>look at my naughty<br>well the you know<br>that’s one thing<br>if you’re a woman you know<br>if you’re a grown woman that’s what you like<br>and you know what the fuck ever who gives a shit<br>you want to go pierce your balls<br>go do it who gives a shit<br>but for little kids<br>that’s not that’s not cool man to have a six year<br>old dress like a hub no no<br>it’s disturbing it is disturbing<br>it felt very wrong<br>you know and<br>you know like their whole job in a ramsay case<br>man that that shit disturbed<br>I still don’t know that in that case<br>yet they don’t know<br>we’re gonna find out<br>the dad’s live<br>I believe the mom’s dead they all died<br>maybe the dad’s dead too it’s possible anyway<br>no Twitter verse<br>yeah Twitter verse has not cool and I agree<br>you know eye heels are just as much<br>an establishment as a males tie is both are silly<br>that’s true that’s true bronchizer<br>god damn this Twitter shit goes too fast bron hyzer<br>yeah you know you’re absolutely right<br>I think ties are completely ridiculous<br>I didn’t even<br>I haven’t worn a tie in a long<br>I did a documentary recently on dmt<br>and<br>I had to wear a tie<br>because I played like a rod sterling type narrator<br>it’s a really interesting documentary on dmt<br>it’ll be out sometime to spring<br>but I had to wear a tie<br>I had no idea how to tie this fucking thing<br>I had no idea the last time I wore a tie was<br>my my first album grab that thing off the wall okay<br>my first album in 1999<br>you know just as a goof<br>one of the things<br>I always said that I love about being a comedian is<br>that you don’t have to wear a fucking tie<br>and so<br>just my first CD<br>for whatever reason I just thought it would be funny<br>if I wore a tie<br>I don’t know it doesn’t make any sense<br>just look strange<br>I had to wear a tie for like 10 years<br>every day suck<br>yeah if you want to like work in businessman it’s like<br>there’s an agreement like everyone has to know<br>that you are willing to wear something<br>completely ridiculous because you’re following by<br>the very obvious rules of behavior<br>it’s going to be really easy to predict<br>what you’re doing<br>that’s what people like like I’m a gentleman<br>you know like as a gentleman<br>well I feel this I’m a gentleman who’ve got its tian<br>hello gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen<br>you know it’s like there’s this like<br>this agreement that you’re not going to get too crazy<br>you’re not going to<br>it’s like my doctor feel impression<br>you know bottom moshi was shining<br>they are very slippery<br>I’m not chasing after anybody you know<br>it’s like there’s something to that<br>there’s something to this<br>silly outfit that you wear that’s uncomfortable<br>like if people started doing business<br>and they had like<br>rash guards on<br>like lycro rash guards on like they’re ready to go<br>jujitsu and shit<br>you know like<br>why would that be bad<br>but it is bad<br>you know you can’t have like board shorts and<br>you know saying you know running shoes on<br>and you look like you like<br>you ready to fucking pounce on people that<br>nobody wants that in business you can’t have<br>and when you go to business<br>you have to be dressed uncomfortable<br>your button has to be all the way up here<br>you know it’s fucking ridiculous you know I hate it<br>I remember I used to work at this<br>architect firm for my stepfather<br>and this was when I was<br>big into acid and stuff like that<br>so every time I would come to work I was either<br>hung over<br>still tripping on acid and you know<br>or something like that<br>it was such a boring job that it was acceptable<br>because all I had to do<br>is make copies of architect plans<br>do you think you you fucked up your brain on acid<br>do you think you have fucked up your brain on um<br>no no I think I think if<br>when I was doing it I was I was<br>there was there any point<br>like you know<br>you ever heard howard stern talk about his acid trip<br>no howard stern<br>talked about it on the radio<br>and I guess he did like a giant dose of acid like way<br>too much and<br>he was like all fucked up for like a long time<br>like he was here in voices<br>and it was just like a like a real psychotic episode<br>and<br>you know that’s a really<br>that’s a thing about psychedelics<br>like you got to make sure you don’t<br>fuck around and do too much like<br>dennis mckenna had<br>an experience like that too<br>dennis mckenna<br>with whose terrence mckenna’s brother they’re both<br>famous psychonauts for psychedelic pioneers<br>in the seventies they went to<br>Brazil and he took<br>way too much mushrooms<br>and he lost his mind<br>for like two weeks<br>like he couldn’t communicate with people<br>you know and the last time I did dmt<br>I was fucking whacked out for like two solid weeks<br>not totally<br>you wouldn’t guess if you were talking to me<br>I was totally normal<br>I did shows the shows went great<br>I went to work I did fear fact that that went great<br>you know<br>nothing nothing got fucked up in my butt my head<br>was like I fell very<br>you know you feel<br>like your consciousness is like in a foundation<br>your consciousness is like you know like<br>it’s like boom it’s solid this is me<br>good morning you wake up in the morning<br>hi honey you kiss your girlfriend brush your teeth<br>this is fucking solid<br>when I did the dmt<br>my consciousness was like<br>a little tiny raft in a fucked up ocean<br>it’s like you know<br>like nothing seemed like I kept having these ideas<br>that cars were going to come<br>launching themselves over<br>the boundaries and hit my car while I was driving<br>and I’m like why am I thinking this<br>I’m like what is this about<br>and then I realized that what it was was at<br>this idea of worrying about possible disasters<br>was my ego’s way of regaining ground<br>and letting me know that it has to have<br>a certain amount of<br>real estate in reality and that<br>if you want to do<br>crazy crazy psychedelics and go into other dimensions<br>communicate with entities and re evaluate<br>your whole position in the world and<br>and humankind’s position with each other<br>that’s all well and good<br>but there’s some real shit in the world<br>that the ego has to be there for<br>and the ego was like sending me a message<br>oh dude what if a fucking car<br>launched itself out<br>you better be fucking paying attention<br>like there was a certain amount of<br>where it was such a mind blowing experience<br>that there was like a wrestling match going on<br>in my head between my ego<br>and between these new information<br>and accepting<br>all this new information from the psychedelic trip<br>and<br>incorporating it into the way I look at everyday life<br>you know and like<br>you know you think about someone who’s like a real<br>like a shaman<br>you know they’re living in a jungle and they’re all<br>at peace in the world<br>they’re not calling people douchebags in the internet<br>you know there’s a certain amount of enlightenment<br>that if you achieve it<br>it’s going to make it very hard for you to function<br>in the regular world<br>and I think that’s one of the most important things<br>about psychedelic trips like there’s a lot of cripples<br>in the psychedelic world and in<br>the weed world too<br>there’s a lot of people that<br>they’re so into these experiences<br>that they can’t<br>incorporate it into their everyday life<br>and they’re almost<br>crippled in their everyday life because of it<br>and no psychedelic experience is worth anything<br>unless<br>you can take what you’ve learned from it and enhance<br>regular life enhance<br>your communication with people<br>your relationships with people<br>you know enhance the way you look at the world<br>enhance your career path<br>you know the kind of friends you hang around<br>unless it can enhance you<br>the reality is<br>we live in this world<br>for 8h a day or 12h a day or how long you’re awake<br>this world this shit this concrete world is real<br>and you have to manage your way through this<br>and<br>psychedelic drugs make it very difficult to do that<br>if you want to have a regular job I think psychedelics<br>what’s<br>the main thing with psychedelics is it opens up a door<br>and like in the past like I’ve been offered dmt<br>but I won’t do it because<br>like when I first did<br>mushrooms that opened up to a door<br>of things that never<br>thought of or saw before<br>and it’s never going to go away<br>it didn’t damage my head<br>but now that I know that exists I know it’s there<br>and so when acid did the same thing<br>but there’s a point where I have to go okay<br>is this door<br>does this door need to be open is this anything<br>paused with this door being open<br>and some drugs are like that for me<br>because like salvia<br>was the closest to the point where I was like okay<br>that is a scary door that I opened up<br>because that just pretty much made everything seem fake<br>like it was like<br>this world is fake<br>everything’s fake and I know that’s not true<br>but it opened up that door where I’m like okay<br>that’s almost too much of a door<br>I shouldn’t have opened up that door<br>I’m never gonna be able to get back that<br>that thought of not knowing that was there<br>I think that’s<br>pretty much saying the same thing yeah it’s like<br>if you can’t bring it back<br>and incorporate it into your everyday life<br>and like sometimes you open up these doors<br>you’re like the fuck am I gonna do with this right<br>and then your everyday life is just whacked out<br>some people like going back to that<br>that fake world so much though<br>and that’s where it gets fucking scared<br>well you know what I think most of those people<br>their real world is not so hot right<br>you know<br>and that’s one of the reasons why it becomes an escape<br>you know and I don’t think it should be an escape<br>I don’t think you should ever escape reality<br>you’re here this is life<br>you know life can be a magical fucking intense<br>fantastic experience if you manage<br>it correctly<br>but if you just want to escape all the time<br>I’ve got to think that you’re probably<br>fucking up in this life and that’s imbalanced<br>you know people that always want to go and it’s like<br>like the same thing with like video games<br>like remember<br>I told you about this dude<br>there was this dude<br>who used to be a manager at the comedy store<br>that was addicted to everquest<br>just completely addicted eight ten twelveh a day<br>lost everything<br>lost his job lost his life<br>he just was so pale you would see him he was so pale<br>looked like he’d never saw sunlight<br>like he would order in food<br>and never leave the fucking house for days<br>and he came down the comic storm one night and he goes<br>it’s so weird I’m so good at making<br>money in my online life and so bad in my real life<br>he was started to realize that like he’s<br>a fucking loser in this life because he’s excited<br>and puts all of his passion and energy<br>into this other life<br>but that’s just really because this other life<br>is a new and exciting thing<br>you know<br>a new and artificial thing and he can control it from<br>his computer without<br>dealing with emotions and dealing with all the<br>you know<br>the fears and anxieties that the real world presents<br>but the reality is<br>if we live life in a computer screen<br>and we were offered the real world<br>as a video game<br>the real world would be so much more fantastic<br>you know<br>we just don’t think of it as being fantastic because<br>we’re so goddamn used to it<br>you know if we lived life in a computer<br>in a computer monitor<br>and that’s how you were when you were born<br>and then one day someone said you know<br>hey we’ve developed this new game<br>that allows you to go outside<br>and you go outside and you can actually get laid<br>and you can go and have a real drink and you feel it<br>you do a real shot of jack to end<br>there’s a holy shit this is real<br>I can’t believe it<br>know you go get laid for real and you drive a car<br>for real you’d be like dude the real world beat stuff<br>fucking shit you would never want to play video games<br>the reason why we want to play video games is because<br>it’s a world that we can control<br>completely independent from all<br>the pros and cons of this solid world<br>completely independent of the emotions and the<br>insecurities and all the shit that we all experience<br>but we don’t like<br>but the reason why we experience<br>insecurities and anxiety and anger<br>these are all like little chemical signals to guide you<br>through towards a proper life<br>like what I found in life<br>most importantly more than anything is the one<br>the way that I’m the most happiest is if<br>I’m putting out<br>positive energy<br>I’m putting out positive energy to people to friends<br>positive energy on stage<br>positive energy with my writing my work<br>with anything I’m doing<br>it’s all friendly and positive and happy<br>and if you do that<br>you know you can you can have a fucking fantastic life<br>the problem is it’s just difficult to do<br>it’s hard to keep your shit together<br>it’s hard not to lose your temper it’s hard<br>not to you know<br>be obsessed with something and<br>get sidetracked and that’s like<br>gambling addictions and<br>masturbation addictions and all that shit<br>that’s all about<br>it’s like you’re trying to distract yourselves<br>from all the pain of being a human<br>you know I mean I think<br>fucking hunter s thompson had a quote like that like<br>man making himself a beast<br>to get away from the pain of being a man<br>I forgot exactly what the quote was<br>but there was something along those lines<br>like we distract the shit of ourselves<br>because the game of life is fucking hard to do man<br>just like a video game is hard to do<br>you know you remember<br>like black when I used to play quake<br>like all the time<br>I played quake like hours and hours a day<br>and you and I played quake online<br>we played against each other<br>and like<br>you can tell the difference between someone is<br>playing all the time<br>because you get really good at it<br>you know you know where those bakuts you’re gonna go<br>I was sticking rail guns up your ass and electrode<br>yeah I think you won 120 games and I won one<br>yeah maybe not totally not fair<br>like and believe me<br>there’s dudes online that would do that to me<br>just rape me why<br>because they had put so much time<br>in this fucking crazy game<br>they would get good at it<br>but since you hadn’t put time how frustrating was it<br>so fuck here so you didn’t want to play it right<br>you want to shut it off<br>that’s exactly the same as life<br>if you get good at life of the game<br>then it’s fun as fuck<br>it’s awesome you know<br>if you’re lean ordered to caprio<br>life must be the shit you know<br>I’m saying he’s starring in movies<br>driving a ferrari getting hanging supermodels what<br>he’s got a gigantic fucking mansion<br>I mean he’s a boot we must be so fun for him<br>but not everybody could be leonardo caprio<br>so if you’re the fucking garbage man who’s you know<br>team home and his wife is fucking<br>the newspaper guy you know<br>that’s not a fun life<br>that’s just like<br>a guy who’s not good at quake getting murdered<br>in a game it’s not fun man<br>it’s like playing pool<br>if you’re good like I play pool I love pool<br>I get obsessed with it<br>but I have a friend my friend max eberley<br>he’s a professional and he’s a top professional<br>I mean he’s capable<br>winning when he’s in stroke<br>capable of winning any tournament in the world<br>I mean he’s really fucking good<br>and when I play against him<br>sometimes it’s so frustrating and I play pretty good<br>like for a regular person I play good<br>but for like a pro<br>not even fucking close<br>so when I play max it’s just<br>getting my ass handed to me<br>it’s just getting fucked<br>the only time<br>it’s fun is when we play on a really<br>really tight table so occasionally he misses<br>and then I’m like oh I get to shoot<br>you know so he’s much better at that game<br>you should give him a handicap or some sort of thing<br>well we no<br>we just we don’t play for anything and it’s good for me<br>good for me because<br>you get used to playing against a guy like that<br>it’s not as fun<br>it’s playing against a guy who’s like your speed<br>but it’s really good for your game<br>because it makes sure<br>that you capitalize on every mistake<br>sometimes you play a guy who’s not as good as you<br>and you’re like<br>I don’t worry about this<br>because if I miss this<br>guy’s gonna miss and I’ll have another shot<br>but with max every time you miss you like fuck<br>I better you know I better sit down for a while<br>anyway I believe that<br>the hunter ass quote is actually<br>from samuel johnson and English author<br>thank you<br>very much sir I thought it was 100 toxic quote<br>thank you<br>cj mick el<br>henny mick el hinney<br>what about words names like swartzenegger<br>how the fuck did that ever get through<br>like what culture<br>ran out of sounds<br>people that had a string together<br>something nutty like that<br>people that like to write in cursive<br>is that it like this<br>is gonna be the best curse of writing I’ve ever seen<br>right like manuscripts they used to write it on page<br>they didn’t have lines in the paper<br>they just had paper<br>and they would write it exactly<br>have you ever heard of the von yiks manuscript<br>the<br>von yet manuscript I don’t know if I’m saying it right<br>is this ancient manuscript that was found<br>hundreds of years old and they have no fucking idea<br>what it says they don’t know the language<br>they don’t know anything about it<br>they don’t know if it’s just nonsense<br>if some guy was just practicing scribble<br>but it’s like really long<br>and it’s yeah<br>and there’s consistency and how it’s written but<br>they can’t decode it<br>they’ve had top encryption experts<br>and it’s very divided<br>like some people believe it’s a hoax<br>and some people believe<br>that it’s some fucking loss language<br>and some people think that it’s<br>gloss alailia<br>like when someone talks in tongues<br>and that they just went<br>into a fucking trance<br>oh just some retard with a pen<br>because it’s got really good writing it’s got<br>diagrams in it and really good really good<br>illustrations rather and diagrams in it<br>it’s like<br>yeah it’s really complicated you know and they’ve found<br>that temple and turkey<br>that is 7000 years older than the Pyramids<br>a very complex stone temple<br>carved out of stone and shit<br>and now they have to like rewrite like human history<br>because like 7000 years before Egypt is 19,000 bc<br>and 10,000 bc<br>they already<br>like had temples and were worshiping shit and like<br>that throws a monkey ranch clank<br>into the whole gears of<br>the idea of cultural evolution<br>you know and this has been this guy<br>john anthony west<br>john anthony west looked out up on google<br>because this guy is fascinating<br>he’s got an awesome<br>dvd series called magical Egypt<br>and this guy is obsessed with Egypt<br>he spent his entire life<br>studying Egypt<br>and he believes that the Egyptian culture goes back way<br>way way before the established timelines<br>like the established timelines for Egyptian cultures<br>like 20,500 bc<br>that’s when they think like the Pyramids were built<br>and then the culture goes back a little bit before that<br>but not much<br>and he thinks it goes back like 35,000 years<br>he thinks that people have been around way way longer<br>and that there was some big<br>break somewhere along the line<br>like probably<br>some sort of a natural cataclysmic disaster<br>like a meteor impact or something like that<br>you know and it could be you know 25,000 years<br>ago like they don’t know when it was<br>but they think that there was like an advanced culture<br>and then boom it got fucked up<br>and then culture rebuilds<br>society rebuilds and then what’s left<br>is like they’re living in this ship<br>that was made thousands and thousands of years ago<br>and they tried to imitate it and recreate it<br>and they can’t<br>and he believes that that’s what it is like these these<br>fucked up Pyramids that they have at Egypt<br>it’s not<br>that these Pyramids were like the first Pyramids<br>he thinks much<br>much more likely<br>these Pyramids were probably<br>like people were just like trying to duplicate<br>other shit duplicate shit that was already there<br>you know they believe that<br>that’s not his theory that’s someone else’s theory<br>his theory is<br>one of the things is about the sphinx they brought in<br>geologists and the geologists have like<br>documented the erosion and the sphinx<br>and they say there’s water erosion<br>the thousands of years a rainfall have cut<br>deep fissures<br>in the whole enclosure where the sphinx is<br>and the problem with that is the last<br>time there was rainfall in The Nile valley was like<br>16,000 bc so that would mean that<br>the Pyramids<br>or the sphinx rather would have to be like<br>7000 years older<br>than the established timeline<br>and so of course none of the<br>the<br>egyptologists like the guys have been teaching forever<br>that the Pyramids in the spanks and all that was<br>built about 20,500 bc<br>they never want they don’t want to accept it<br>they go well where’s the evidence for this culture<br>like it’s right<br>there man there’s fucking<br>rainfall for thousands of years have created this<br>and geologists are<br>universal about that<br>there’s no one who’s disputing that<br>the geologists are all saying he’s got hunt this guy<br>ron shock who’s<br>a professor at Boston university<br>has got over 100 professional<br>professors geologists<br>to sign off on the fact that this is undoubtedly<br>water erosion which<br>completely changes the timeline for when<br>the sphinx was built<br>and there’s a bunch of that shit going on in Egypt<br>they believe that it’s like probably<br>you know maybe even 30,000 years old<br>there’s a mass extinction took place<br>on the earth somewhere around 10,000 years ago<br>and that’s when the<br>woolly mammus died<br>instantaneously<br>that’s when the sabertooth tigers died noah’s ark<br>no that’s before them<br>but the the<br>like 10,000 years ago<br>north america<br>like half of north america was under a mile high<br>sheet of ice like there was an ice age going on<br>and something killed it and ended it<br>like instantaneously<br>and they don’t know what it was<br>and it’s very<br>very likely that it was a fucking natural disaster<br>it’s very likely that it was a fucking media impact<br>that some well what happened that guy’s arm<br>you’re distracting the shit out of me son<br>don’t look at me<br>well don’t fucking have a monitor open in front<br>of me dude surf and he’s not even pay attention<br>we do one week podcap<br>this dude is so addicted to the internet<br>he can’t even talk for one week<br>I’ve heard you talk before<br>you’ve heard me talk<br>well this is online dude<br>this 675 people but have not heard this story<br>don’t look at me<br>shut up fuck it<br>anyway I think people have been around way longer<br>I think it’s much more likely that it’s just<br>ridiculous that people still don’t believe in<br>and how long this world’s been around<br>you know what I mean<br>oh like people believe the earth’s 10,000 years old<br>it just drives me crazy<br>well you know that’s a not monster number<br>more than 50% of america according to a gallapole<br>which is not the same<br>because<br>here’s the thing about polls<br>you can’t say like according to a recent poll<br>50% of americans believe this because no<br>no according to your recent poll<br>50% of americans who are fucking retarded<br>enough to answer your poll<br>believe in that<br>that’s the reality of<br>polls are never representative of anybody intelligent<br>because you can’t get me to answer a fucking poll<br>you can’t get you you got shit to do<br>don’t you have a hobby<br>you hear something calls you may I have 5min your time<br>no that’s for like old ladies who have no friends<br>that’s what that is right<br>well look at this glitter or<br>I’m fucking super baked and I just don’t<br>want to hang up in a person and I’m like um okay<br>5min okay you know I’m trying to be nice<br>but the reality is polls polls represent retards<br>you know<br>you’re fucking you’re a duller you’re answering poles<br>god damn it<br>the only time I do it pull is if<br>I think I’m going to win something<br>if I answer 20% of americans can’t find<br>the United States on a globe<br>is that true<br>joe beef don’t be lying joe beef beef is lying<br>joe beef would you make that shit up<br>solar flares up in 2012 bro<br>we’re closs in the galactic equator then<br>you know what you know<br>uh there’s a guy which is a richard tyson<br>is that his name is<br>what is that guy’s name<br>the astronomer<br>really neal tyson neal tyson<br>very very intelligent guy<br>and I really like listen to him talk<br>and one of the things he said<br>about this whole crossing the aquatic<br>whatever the what is it what is that the exact<br>the way this guy galactic equator<br>I think that’s what this guy said<br>yeah like<br>we’re crossing through the center of the galaxy like<br>everything’s in line<br>on December twenty first two thousand twelve<br>you know what he says<br>he says that happens all the time<br>he says he says that<br>like that like line up with the center of the galaxy<br>that<br>doesn’t happen then because it happens all the time<br>and nothing happens<br>so<br>who knows if he’s right or if he’s one of those guys<br>it’s like super skeptical<br>but I think what’s much more likely is gonna happen<br>in 2012 is something<br>technological<br>something technological some crazy invention<br>you know like<br>I don’t think it’d be anything<br>it could be that too<br>it could be that 2012 what really happened is<br>nothing happens and then people realize oh<br>we have to actually manage this life<br>we can’t just rely on fucking aliens landing<br>I was more scared about 2000 just because it that made<br>sense<br>with all the computers planes dropping from the sky<br>I was scared too I didn’t<br>do a gig 2000 I stayed home<br>yeah I thought<br>sure there was at least gonna be something small<br>when 2000 isn’t it crazy that that’s 10 years ago now<br>time is just fucking flying by man it’s crazy fast<br>it’s weird it almost feels like it’s quicker every year<br>and everybody says that<br>but what if time really is quicker<br>what if like clocks are moving quicker too<br>we just can’t really establish it because<br>that wouldn’t make sense<br>because what about digital clocks<br>no<br>they all exist in this fucking dimension<br>maybe this dimension is moving quicker<br>units of time are yeah almost<br>I think we’re forgetting more<br>so it feels like we’re forgetting more of the day<br>because we have more information<br>yeah yeah maybe right<br>I’m free for appetiteers<br>thoughts on the zeitgeist movement<br>you know what I think about<br>zeitgeist and all that stuff<br>there’s a lot of zeitgeist that’s poorly researched<br>like the stuff that he said about mithra and different<br>different<br>gods and stuff that that are just like jesus<br>well that’s really<br>poorly researched and incorrect and been proven wrong<br>there’s a website that says<br>I think it’s<br>it’s common<br>debunking zite guys or something like that to forget<br>what the website is titled but<br>I mean the guy just<br>breaks down all the errors that the dude who<br>made the movie made<br>and it’s just you know<br>he’s quoting references and showing very clearly that<br>the like guys guys have made some big problem<br>big big fuck ups and I think his whole<br>though how sure he is<br>this September 11th was was<br>designed and that you know the<br>inperpetrated by the us government and that<br>tower one and tower two fell<br>because they were<br>they were detonated like you’re sure of that<br>you know look<br>no one’s sure that that’s crazy you can’t set free spa<br>all this talk of<br>free fall speed and the towers fell at free fall speed<br>yeah they fell pretty fucking fast<br>but that’s what happens when shit falls apart<br>it falls apart pretty fucking fast<br>especially shit that’s super heavy<br>and gigantic and all that weight is on<br>and it’s all just collapsing<br>who the fuck knows<br>what happens when you build a building that way<br>and you fly<br>a fucking giant playing filled with jet fuel into it<br>the only way to really know<br>I mean you can have theories<br>but the only way to really<br>know is to build another building<br>and fly another jet<br>into it exactly the same way and see what happens<br>and if it falls down exactly like that one<br>then the argument’s pretty much over<br>and if it doesn’t then you have to go well okay<br>well what was inside the building<br>did it all burn the same<br>was it exactly constructed the same<br>you know and then you gotta try it again<br>I mean you have to fucking have<br>more than two buildings to go on<br>and everybody’s like buildings have never<br>fallen before<br>look the government does some nasty evil shit<br>that is absolutely a fact<br>but you don’t know<br>you don’t know what happened there and to say<br>that you know<br>is just as bad as people<br>who blindly trust in the us government<br>the thing that I have a big question<br>about when it comes to tim 11th<br>is tower seven<br>and if you watch video<br>online there’s video of tower seven falling<br>and it falls just like a controlled demolition<br>I mean it just goes straight down<br>whoosh all at once and it’s really crazy to watch man<br>you know because like<br>it implodes from the basement down and every<br>level falls apart<br>including like jets<br>of energy<br>like spraying out of windows like there’s blasts<br>I mean maybe that could be because it’s collapsing<br>I mean that’s a whole floor of air being right<br>but the problem is it all falls the exact same time<br>and that building wasn’t even hit by a plane<br>it was on fire and it had a hole in it from<br>debris and stuff and I could see it falling down<br>but there was a hole in one corner and the hole<br>if it’s a hole there<br>and the building is going to collapse<br>wouldn’t it collapse towards the hole<br>I mean doesn’t that make sense maybe<br>it also makes sense<br>the whole pop standing on a pop can thing<br>where if you stand on a pop can you knock a little<br>bit off the side<br>it’s not falling over<br>you’re going straight down because of the weight<br>you know I mean<br>it’s so heavy<br>even if there’s a hole on it it doesn’t matter<br>it’s just going straight down<br>mmm that’s maybe maybe<br>I think with all that shit<br>I’m like yeah<br>I’m glad there’s people that freak out<br>about and care about it<br>because without them<br>you know the government’s going to get<br>away with a bunch of shit<br>but in my opinion you know I don’t get care<br>if the government did it<br>fuck they did it you know<br>I’m still waking up eating my cereal<br>well that is one thing you have to consider<br>I mean it’s like you<br>mean how is this gonna help you<br>how is this going to help you in your life I<br>know if you get obsessed with this yeah look too much<br>here’s the bottom line<br>people that think the government wouldn’t kill people<br>and nobody died in tower seven supposedly<br>but they think people are so hard to believe<br>people think that the government would not kill people<br>this is all you need to know for sure<br>they start wars then don’t need to be started<br>that’s 100% fact<br>for sure the gulfetonkin incident that got us<br>into the Vietnam war<br>that was a fake fucking attack on americans<br>they faked it<br>and they faked it made this big deal about it<br>so that everybody would get fired up<br>and realized we have to go to Vietnam<br>that’s fact this is history<br>you know and the fact that<br>they wrote up a thing called operation northwards<br>the northwoods document<br>and the northwoods document was<br>they were planning attacks<br>on americans and they were gonna<br>this is a nineteen sixty two and they were going<br>this is assigned by the joint chiefs of staff<br>by the way and vetoed by kennedy<br>they were gonna attack guantanamo bay<br>they were gonna lob grenades<br>into guantanamo bay and possibly kill american soldiers<br>they were gonna blow up a jet liner<br>and blame it on the cubans<br>and they were gonna<br>tell americans we have to go to war with two<br>but well people were gonna fucking die in that war<br>for sure and<br>people were gonna die in a war that americans didn’t<br>want and so they decided<br>to do what’s called a false flag<br>and make attacks on americans<br>and blame it on the cubans<br>and that’s a fact<br>they’re willing to kill people<br>and only 3000 people died in September 11 for sure<br>that’s a lot of people<br>we’re not making light of it but<br>in comparison to how many people have died<br>in Iraq during the fucking war<br>they’re talking about<br>like 1 million civilians have died in Iraq<br>since the invasion<br>1 million I mean that’s fucking crooked 80 I mean<br>millions of people died from that earthquake in 80 but<br>we didn’t have it hd video<br>fucking you know seeing it products<br>yeah but we didn’t we’re not responsible for that no<br>I know I know<br>I know but I think the reason<br>why is that they’re willing to kill be right right<br>I think the reason<br>why we’re focused on it though is just because of that<br>though we all watched it live<br>where if you know<br>if we saw these people in a racket shot live on<br>tv would probably<br>be just as big as 9 11 you know<br>well I don’t know about that<br>you know I think I think<br>well I think the idea<br>is that it was an attack on american soil<br>I mean that’s really<br>why it was such a big deal<br>and then I mean I remember<br>how everybody got so patriotic after theirs<br>do you remember<br>after September live with how everybody had<br>fucking american flags in their car<br>remember that weird feeling<br>yeah you were<br>you’re still in Ohio back then right right<br>did they have them in Ohio oh yeah it’s crazy bad<br>I left I went to work one day<br>I don’t even think I was doing fear factor at the time<br>I might have been<br>but I was driving down down<br>the street near my house<br>and every fucking car had an american flag on it<br>it was crazy and I was like this is just weird<br>this is a weird feeling it’s<br>like people are bowling up<br>like everybody just go to fucking war<br>you know realize like how war<br>like this fucking culture really is<br>and how sheep like<br>and how people are just immediately willing to fight<br>you know and fight who<br>the people who did it are dead<br>like it was a suicide attack<br>so the people that were responsible for<br>the deaths of those people are all dead<br>I mean<br>unless you’re one of those crazy motherfuckers<br>it doesn’t believe that it was a real plane<br>and then and then there’s people that believe<br>that you know they were<br>piloted by remote control and the planes were emptying<br>who the fuck know<br>shit happened on the list what it’s just<br>it’s almost 10 years and I’m still talking about it<br>oh my god you know<br>it’s so frustrating<br>talking to people who claim to know<br>that’s when it’s really frustrating man it wasn’t a<br>plane it hit the pentagon it was a missile<br>where is all the people<br>that died in the fucking plane crash<br>then what they just<br>they took them<br>and why would they say it’s a plane<br>why would they shoot a missile and say it’s a plane<br>why were there all the plane parts on the lawn<br>I mean come on man we talk about this before it’s all<br>this yeah<br>the plain point<br>yeah<br>and we’ve actually laughed at three or two weeks ago<br>what’s fear factor real nothing is real<br>depends on how much ass would you take<br>joe rogan hates bruce springsteen<br>that is so not true it’s not here<br>are you just trying to get attention motherfucker<br>no I don’t hate bruce bringsteen<br>born to run that’s a great fucking song<br>brilliant disguise<br>that’s a great fucking song<br>never got any bruce brinks do<br>I don’t love all bruce brinkstein<br>I’m not gonna sit through a fucking<br>3h concert of anybody’s<br>yeah it would have to be like<br>richard prior

fucking albums<br>you know if you go back<br>into some of those older albums<br>listen to some of those songs that you don’t know<br>she’s shit you know no<br>no nobody puts out something that everybody loves<br>you know and if I like<br>I mean it’s very<br>rare that I like a whole album from a band<br>you’ve ever been to a real orgy<br>like with more than 10 people<br>having sex in the

broth<br>motherfucker<br>that’s hilarious<br>all right this is what cost all the fucking trouble<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>a goddamn picture of me and david lee roth<br>but it was just to prove that<br>brian has been making this crazy buffets for<br>years because this picture<br>debbie the Iraq was like was it<br>like from 2005<br>it’s like three or four years ago before<br>we got banned from the comedy or<br>the whole community store thing<br>yeah because it was at the comics door right<br>so that’s 2006 maybe<br>it was right before he got together with<br>back together<br>with fan helen before<br>they announced they were going to get back together<br>he was telling us about him yeah though yeah<br>all right I just put it on my little Twitter<br>and then you see brian the background<br>making that crazy face<br>he did that<br>no bullshit fucking hundreds of thousands of times<br>that was a long odyssey just to get one picture put up<br>really wasn’t worth it<br>epic fail indeed<br>deed<br>epic fail always talking about that am no keith and<br>pet fella try out chat roulette<br>you know what<br>I would think about doing that<br>but I don’t want to see any dudes cox randomly<br>I did it I tried it out but<br>I found this<br>this kind of somebody already did this before<br>but I found this a big<br>black chick and I put her on loop and then<br>did it just as in recorded the screen and stuff<br>but it was like maybe 90% cox<br>and I was like this is not funny I don’t<br>I mean it’s really sad that there’s so many<br>creepy people out there they’ve seen it<br>come on well you know what<br>it’s dues that want to show their dicks at work and<br>they just never get the opportunity<br>they get at home<br>and they’re wearing a fucking wrestling mask<br>and they go crazy and political<br>and this just suppression man<br>it’s like catholic school girls<br>number catholic school girls when you were a kid<br>they were always the biggest sluts right<br>yeah yeah why<br>because they never seen the dick<br>they’re wished away<br>to some fucking magical place where only girls exist<br>they have all girl teachers and shit<br>and they’re told that dick’s are evil<br>and they just can’t wait to suck one<br>they can’t wait<br>those bitches can’t wait<br>they can’t wait to get up dick and I’m like oh<br>they just want to do that forbidden thing<br>you know can’t suppress human beings man<br>I’d like to do it with<br>maybe like a five year old girl on loop<br>just sitting there going like this<br>you know<br>like that and see if any of these guys with that<br>dicks if they like put it away<br>or if they sit them all they would fucking love it<br>you think<br>what we could record them and put them on YouTube<br>mmm that’s not about it<br>that’s if we get a fake loop<br>about just girls<br>there’s a little kid just sitting there going<br>like like she’s looking at the monitor<br>and see if the guy<br>immediately disconnects or if he sits there<br>an extra couple seconds<br>so do they well how does it work<br>do they pull their dicks out immediately<br>as soon as the log yeah what it is it’s right<br>it just automatically put you in with a room with<br>another person<br>both on webcam<br>and after they have their dick out instantly<br>when I was doing it when I was doing it was just<br>guy’s stroking<br>it said right when he went in there you’re like<br>okay so that’s what you should do<br>you should we should get a video<br>of like a five or six year old girl<br>just freaking the fuck out from the beginning right<br>so it would only<br>work on the guys in order to be eaten off<br>right because otherwise we’d have to time it like<br>you know hottie or like normally and then go oh my god<br>yeah yeah<br>yeah and have our scream call the police<br>call the police<br>well we didn’t have to dip we just had to go call<br>you know that kind of a doll better better call it<br>let’s freak this

you something<br>everyone’s fucked up<br>don’t you tell me the gays are less repressed<br>of course you more repress society represses gay sex<br>gays are just as fucked up as religion<br>repressing straight sex<br>and a lot of gays grew up in religious households too<br>and that makes them extra fucked up<br>it’s not like a coincidence that gay people<br>do so much crystal math<br>and there’s so many gay people<br>that love to party and<br>their lives become a rack and they<br>fucking towards their immune system<br>gay people there’s a lot of crazy fucking gay people<br>and not repressed<br>doesn’t always mean that you’re not fucked up<br>I mean how about bug chasers<br>how about gay<br>dudes that are purposely trying to get aids<br>you know that you gay due to purposely try to get hiv<br>they want to get it<br>and they think there’s something hot about it<br>and so they go and have unprotected sex unpurposed<br>hoping to get<br>hiv<br>that’s fucked up<br>you know you

just<br>completely insane<br>their bathrooms have weird<br>lights and it’s like you know<br>how you grow up<br>we were talking about this me and eddie and tom<br>but how you know<br>when you grow up you’re taught that everything<br>sucks except america<br>all these little countries are all the same<br>Australia is the shit<br>I mean it’s beautiful it’s clean<br>really nice houses everywhere<br>the restaurants were great<br>the people were friendly<br>you know the economy is not completely fucked<br>you’re driving on the<br>left side of the road which is weird<br>but other than that<br>you can use that<br>what’s the difference<br>you know it’s just what you used to<br>other than that it’s fucking phenomenal<br>I mean other than that<br>what a great country man<br>I mean it’s amazing<br>and comics like uh my friend eddieft<br>he’s huge over there<br>huge guys sells out all over the place does tv shows<br>people come to see him<br>he told me<br>they write about him in the paper when he’s had a bar<br>but in america you<br>can’t fucking<br>get traction for whatever reason<br>arch Boston ufc<br>yeah it was great ufc<br>arj barker’s gigantic in Australia fucking monstrous<br>he sold out some place<br>supposedly it was like a 1500 seed place<br>sold it out something like 20 something nights in a row<br>I mean it just<br>craziness they love american comedians over there<br>so the show was fucking fantastic<br>I had a great time<br>a few people walked out but that’s gonna happen<br>man if you don’t know what you’re getting into<br>you know<br>I was trying to tell people that<br>if there was a big sign in the final show<br>that said warning this show will contain language<br>and material as extreme as you could possibly imagine<br>but apparently<br>some of the shit I said people couldn’t imagine<br>they didn’t know what to expect<br>but<br>sorry you got bummed out but<br>99% of the people had a great fucking time<br>but yeah it was a pretty wild crazy show<br>but also it was because we were hammered that night too<br>so two nights in a row we got barbecue<br>so I was planning on going Australia<br>and doing all this writing<br>but alcohol just<br>sticks a fork and all those plans you know<br>you said<br>that when you flew to Australia it was like 17h<br>was the flight<br>really did it really<br>feel like 17h was at the point where you were<br>just like fuck this<br>I need to jump off this plane<br>this is too much or no<br>no no I know isn’t that bad<br>you know you just the cats are fighting<br>you know you just<br>you read you watch a fucking movie<br>get on your laptop<br>all right I was you know<br>going over some material on the way over there<br>the real problem was once I got there<br>I thought I was gonna write<br>but it was just so<br>it was all get drunk<br>recover from the drunk<br>trick a lot of water get drunk again recover<br>you have like small little bedrooms almost on the plane<br>right plane was dope<br>but flew first class on qantas and it’s some<br>I think it’s called a three<br>ten or something like that giant ass fucking plane<br>and they’re huge man<br>they’re like it’s like a little apartment man<br>was like coach like<br>I don’t know kutans was like kutans no<br>coach is just fucking coach man<br>business class is pretty dope<br>business class is just as good as first class<br>wow pretty close to it<br>but<br>coach fuck you they said they don’t cost yeah go on<br>I’d been like hey let me hang out in your bedroom<br>I can’t imagine<br>flying 16h of one of these ass chairs just<br>jam next to raphae may on one side<br>and kevin smith and the other<br>gt<br>gt but after<br>they ran a marathon I can’t believe<br>there’s somebody kicked kevin smith off<br>its fucking thing<br>how dumb are you like<br>do you not know who I guess<br>a lot of people don’t know who he is with<br>like the way he looks like they don’t know that<br>that’s that famous director<br>you might want to shut the fuck up<br>that guy’s on Twitter all day<br>every day he probably ruined southwest<br>that cost them money for sure do you think<br>well<br>part of me thinks so<br>but then the other part of me is like they just got<br>so much attention<br>you know especially if you hate fat people<br>you’d be like fuck<br>yeah I’m going to southwest all the way<br>but they lost the fat dollar<br>I bet there’s a lot of fat people who got bummed out<br>how does ralphie may fly southwest<br>because<br>cause you know how much money that probably saved them<br>all these<br>pissed off fat people that aren’t flying southwest now<br>just save them<br>ah there’s already studies that they were<br>thinking this is ridiculous<br>they were thinking about making you take a shit before<br>you flew because they found out<br>that if they made everyone go to the bathroom before<br>they got on the airplane that they would say<br>so many dollars per year<br>this was a real study that they were going to do<br>southwest this was in southwest<br>this was american airlines or something like that<br>so can you imagine<br>now that they have all these fat people<br>pissed off we’re not gonna fly southwest<br>it’s probably<br>they’re probably earning $5 million a year<br>I wonder how much it cost them more<br>to fly like fuel<br>wise to Australia for a fat guy than for<br>like a smaller<br>oh I’m sure it’s big enough times 100<br>then you would imagine oh my god you know<br>huh yeah that kind of makes sense<br>maybe southwest paid kevin smith in isis all<br>just to save them 1 million a couple million a year<br>I would never do that<br>kevin smith has integrity<br>I met him he was cool he wouldn’t do that<br>yeah he is really cool he’s a very nice guy<br>yeah I met him when I came in to do k rock ones<br>krq in la<br>very fun radio<br>the last<br>of the terrestrial radio stations in la<br>fucking radio in la is vanished<br>I wanted to do radio for a long time<br>I was thinking about doing it<br>you know I was thinking what a cool thing that would be<br>like we have some<br>interesting conversations you take callers<br>talk to people online shit<br>you know but<br>it just died when they had that 97.1 in a fm talk<br>I was like how cool would that be<br>let’s get out let’s get a fucking radio gig<br>you know let’s do well<br>you were gonna do it in Denver he would be back<br>yeah I was thinking about doing it in Denver<br>I was thinking when are you going back to Denver<br>people who keep on asking me that<br>well this ufc in March but

with a mask on<br>mm hmm<br>okay ladies and gentlemen<br>let’s go to the message<br>questions o’brien is a new look oh with the beard<br>well you know what he’s got 35 million in the bank now<br>just kicking it you know<br>today I interviewed a squirrel in my backyard<br>and then through to commercial<br>somebody help me<br>oh it’s pretty blood conan brian now is a Twitter<br>by the way it’s conan o’brien<br>I love the whole conan story<br>it just shows you how retarded networks are<br>you know and first of all<br>they should have never changed shit<br>you know what they should have done<br>I appreciate the jimmy fallon<br>people enjoy jimmy fallon show<br>but you know what<br>put that on after conan o’brien you know<br>go back to the way you had it don’t be stupid<br>you want to go jay leon out tonight show<br>while you want to go middle america and throw<br>softballs and<br>not offend anybody<br>and then keep the conan o’brien show where it was<br>because with conan’s on<br>he can do all that craziness the fucking<br>insult dog masturbing<br>but he do it late at night because<br>you’re allowed to do more crazy shit late at night<br>you know what’s his face<br>remember when we were talking norm mcdonald<br>outside the ice house<br>he had the best point<br>norm mcdonald goes he goes<br>what fucking difference does it make what time he’s on<br>anyway<br>nobody watches it you watch out on your fucking dvr or<br>you see it on YouTube<br>who cares we’re gonna 1130 or 1230<br>it’s twelve thirtys better<br>you can get away with more shit<br>he was totally right<br>I like how he’s saying all this<br>but yeah his phone was from nineteen eighty two<br>so I was like you know<br>the fact that he had a phone at all<br>when I ran into him<br>I ran into norm mcdonald once<br>when I was doing some canadian gigs like<br>a couple of years ago<br>and when I ran into him he didn’t have a cell phone<br>I had a call his home phone<br>that’s right it never fucking cell phone<br>I didn’t have one<br>because I don’t want people to just<br>be able to get in touch with me<br>sometimes I was just trying to fuck off and disappear<br>I love that dude<br>he’s hilarious man<br>he’s<br>norm mcdonald hosting a talk show would be the shit<br>yeah that would be<br>I would tune into that talk show<br>because<br>he wouldn’t let get people get away with anything<br>you know he’s nuts you<br>know he’s a loose dude he’s wild<br>he would be a good couch guy for like conan<br>because if you were seeing him on the couch with like<br>I forget who it was<br>in the whole time he was like krakenshow<br>that was awesome<br>yeah he would be a good<br>good side guy yeah<br>and you know I have like a straight guy<br>and then he’s the goods of the side guy<br>yeah<br>what is my take on the weed stores in la getting rated<br>fucking sucks<br>you know the whole thing makes me makes me sick<br>you know the whole thing is so<br>so strange man<br>it’s so strange that they’re still fucking with people<br>apparently the way the law is presented<br>though in California<br>and I’m not sure this<br>is that they believe<br>that the way the law is presented is that<br>you can give weed away<br>and you can<br>sell it as long as you’re not making a profit<br>and that these<br>collectives are supposed to be to provide<br>medical patients with marijuana<br>but apparently there’s people out there that are<br>flaunting the wealth and they’re making<br>a fuck load of money off of it<br>millions and millions of dollars off selling wheat<br>now if that’s the case there’s two parts of me<br>one part of me that says well you know what fuck you<br>they should be able to sell it<br>you know<br>you guys are douchebags but another part of me says hmm<br>maybe it’d be better<br>maybe it’d be really in the spirit of weed<br>if it was free<br>maybe you really<br>would be in the spirit of weed that it isn’t<br>there isn’t for profit<br>you know people will go down and<br>these stores couldn’t exist and they couldn’t sell it<br>yeah but weed’s not that hard to grow man<br>people would still grow and sell weed<br>and you know people would sell it illegally<br>I mean there would be plenty of people that would<br>you know if you want good weed<br>you got to talk to this guy and it’s expensive<br>but I kind of liked the idea of it not being for profit<br>there’s something about it<br>that<br>bugs me that people are overcharging for this plant<br>just because it’s illegal<br>it means fucking<br>some places it’s super expensive you know<br>five six hundred dollars announced for like really<br>powerful potent weed<br>you know which I<br>understand that the gotcha get paid for his growing<br>and this and that<br>and I totally respect that<br>you should be able to make a certain amount<br>of money for it<br>but if it was legal<br>it would be way fucking cheaper than it is right now<br>the reality is the reason why it’s expensive at all<br>the reason why these guys<br>can make<br>millions of dollars and profit off of selling weed<br>is only because<br>it’s illegal and difficult to get<br>and you have to get it from these places<br>if marijuana was legal<br>and you could grow your own which is how it should be<br>you would have no need to buy it<br>you could have a little fucking plant in your backyard<br>or pretty much<br>already is like that though but it’s not<br>this guy got fucking arrested<br>it’s not this guy just got arrested<br>this guy just got arrested with 24 different counts<br>and he’s gonna charge him<br>and the way it works apparently is<br>what obama has said is that they’re not<br>going to charge people<br>who are only<br>violating federal law because federally it’s illegal<br>they’re going to go after people who are going to<br>violate both federal and state laws<br>so you have to follow the state law to the letter<br>and they’re making an example out of this one dude<br>apparently well<br>I mean if you go and get a license<br>you’re allowed to grow wet<br>seven plants or something like that<br>yeah you’re allowed to grow a lot<br>you’re allowed to have like a half a pound of weed<br>yeah you could even get other<br>license that you can do up to like 21 plant<br>yes I got that yeah you have that for some very reason<br>anyway it asked me if<br>I needed exemption<br>and I said what’s in the exemption for it goes well<br>the regular amount of weed is not enough oh yes<br>the regular amount is not enough<br>I need more so you could pretty much anyone<br>anyone can get that<br>even kids could probably get this shit<br>but they can get that license<br>so if you just grow<br>within your amount you could pretty much do that now<br>and even if the cops came over your house right<br>but it could be people that don’t have the room to grow<br>and they don’t want to be hassled<br>and they want to be able to go out and purchase it<br>at a regionable rate<br>and I agree there is a reasonable rate<br>but right now<br>the rate is so high<br>that marijuana is worth more than gold<br>marijuana is worth more propound than gold is<br>that seems a little crazy<br>you know I mean<br>it’s definitely inflated because<br>of the fact that there’s no competition<br>because of the fact that it’s illegal<br>and it’s a fucking plant<br>it should be legal everybody should be able to grow it<br>if it was legal<br>there would be nobody making<br>millions and millions of dollars outfit<br>the real problem is<br>it would fuck the economy up<br>because pharmaceutical companies would just fucking<br>nose dive there would be<br>so many different pharmaceutical products<br>that would be<br>they would be useless<br>you know I believe that to a point<br>but<br>right now I’d have wheat whenever I want to have wheat<br>but I still have<br>tums for my stomach<br>I still have aspirin for headaches you know<br>they didn’t replace any of them right<br>and you don’t have fucking glaucoma<br>dude you know<br>oh yeah I have<br>there’s a lot of different medications for add right<br>there’s a lot those are the $1000000000 medicines<br>it’s not tom’s bro but you know what description<br>most of these<br>people<br>that are saying that it’s the best drug for glacoma<br>and stuff are just hippies wanting weed to be legal<br>because if you look at the medication for<br>glacoma in comparison<br>I bet you it’s better than we it’s not<br>you don’t know marijuana is the best for<br>interocular pressure<br>I believe that it’s what it’s called<br>when glaucoma apparently it’s very painful for people<br>and marijuana apparently is the best at relieving that<br>it’s the best<br>restoring people’s appetite<br>when they have chemotherapy<br>that’s why cancer patients like it<br>it’s the best at<br>it’s the best that a lot of different things do<br>there’s people that have had kids that have autism<br>there’s a video that we showed and we played that clip<br>the kid that had autism and<br>it was the only thing that calm the kid down<br>made him normal was weed<br>you know it’s great for a lot of different things<br>and all those different things are prescription drugs<br>that are worth fucking<br>billions of dollars every<br>year to pharmaceutical companies<br>which is why they lobby<br>against recreational drugs<br>so called recreational drugs<br>which is why to this day<br>partnership for a drug free america to this day<br>gets money from pharmaceutical companies<br>they got<br>money from alcohol companies and tobacco companies<br>millions of millions of<br>dollars in the past<br>and because of that it was a lot of criticism<br>so they<br>no longer get money from alcohol and tobacco companies<br>but they<br>still get money from fucking pharmaceutical companies<br>pharmaceutical companies are responsible for oxycodone<br>viking in percocet all that shit<br>I still don’t think it’s going to be like if they<br>made it legal<br>like all these<br>companies are going to go out of business<br>I know my mom’s not going to be smoking weed<br>she’s gonna be like no I’ll take the other thing<br>some people would be dumb enough for a few generations<br>yeah they would be dumb enough<br>well<br>there’s just people that we just doesn’t work with<br>and that’s like that’s 60%<br>that’s never going to change<br>for the things that we’ve talked about<br>it’s not 50 or 60%<br>weed is a<br>real effective medicine for a bunch of different things<br>yeah yeah<br>more importantly it would be great for textiles<br>it would be great for you could eat it<br>I mean<br>it has all the essential fatty acids and the seeds<br>you know amino acids<br>there’s a lot of different fucking<br>things that marijuana is good for<br>besides just getting you high right<br>it’s incredible that it’s illegal<br>it’s really mind blowing that it’s illegal in 2010<br>with the access to information that we have today<br>the fact that it’s still illegal<br>that’s fucking insane man<br>because you stream laggy<br>yeah you streams always laggy man<br>anything on the<br>internet’s laggy nothing works perfect<br>this is fucking<br>the internet is in a<br>it’s in a stage right now it’s not done yet<br>the irs playing crasher guy having a hanger co<br>leased by member of homeland security<br>and having ties to intelligence agencies<br>is that true well I know that he stole that plane<br>so I don’t know it wasn’t his plane<br>if that’s what you’re talking about<br>oh really what you know what<br>I’m all for that guy because what<br>you’re all for<br>that guy that crashes building is playing<br>it didn’t even die in that<br>yes alright I’m sorry I got that just working<br>but fuck the irs<br>wow I’m still dealing with that bullshit<br>they’re like fucking bullshit okay this bad bad<br>bobby’s telling me that gold is<br>one thousand one hundred dollars an ounce<br>in bridge Columbia and<br>the best weed<br>is three thousand two hundred dollars a pound<br>it ain’t more than gold<br>it’s going for less than $17,000 a pound here in the us<br>oh I stand corrected<br>thank you very much sir<br>sounds better<br>the way I said it’s worth more than gold<br>yeah but I know what it’s worth more than gold hash<br>hash is worth more than gold isn’t it<br>damn hashes expensive as fuck<br>how much is a pound of hash go for<br>more than pound to hash high<br>but hashtags fucking<br>punch a hole through to another dimension<br>if you measure he smoked a pound of hash hash<br>they make out of weed somehow or another<br>I’m gonna do it surprising<br>the resin<br>how do they do it though do you know how they make it<br>I don’t have sort of a complicated process<br>but I’ve had it before and it’s very<br>it’s a strange high<br>it’s it’s very very<br>I miss opium strong<br>I’m gonna do opium again<br>opium’s off you did opium<br>fuck yeah that’s not much different than ash really<br>yeah<br>it looks if I was opium it’s like opius so no heroin<br>no no it’s like uh<br>it looks like a piece of soap<br>it smokes like<br>it smokes like hash and it<br>it smells like a hippie like patroli<br>it smells like patroli when it burns<br>really yeah it’s kind of like I don’t know<br>like a hash kind of feeling<br>hmm<br>I’m scared man<br>yeah the the gold thing<br>I didn’t really research that very well<br>it was something else<br>sorry over said that incorrectly there’s something else<br>that that marijuana was more expensive than per ounce<br>maybe it was oil<br>does that make sense<br>worth more than oil<br>more than more than something that’s worth a lot<br>let’s go with some other questions here<br>damn with the u stream powerful u stream<br>opium smells like flowers and is super addictive<br>from the poppy<br>damn faggot<br>why are you doing something super addictive<br>brian’s already digging cigarettes though<br>brian’s cat had a hangnail<br>and that got him to start smoking again<br>could know it was and I got audited by the rs<br>but before that it was your cat got a hang now no<br>it was my cat had a fuck that foot<br>cat out of fucked up fucks<br>his cat outta fucked up fucking<br>fucking can’t take it anymore<br>dude the cigarettes are the worst because<br>cigarettes out of nowhere<br>you’ll be like<br>dude I need a cigarette I need a cigarette<br>it’s one of those things<br>once you do it<br>yet opens up a door that’s always gonna be open<br>and it’s weird cigarettes look at this guy<br>did you know you can activate your pineal<br>by saying the word love at a certain frequency<br>shut up shut the fuck up<br>it’s like that shut up<br>the new mariah carey song<br>has a high enough pitch to open up your garage doors<br>no it doesn’t<br>people love to say stupid shit yes<br>do people love fucking magic<br>they love magic and nonsense<br>you know they love to think that there is<br>like something like that<br>there’s real magic<br>you can real magic<br>eat a pound of mushrooms<br>you want to see something magic<br>instead of having a 16 ounce steak<br>have 16 ounces of mushrooms motherfucker<br>sh boom<br>that’s magic you know<br>yeah<br>you’ll magically be retarded for the rest of your life<br>you’ll probably<br>be communicating with aliens permanently<br>you’ll probably be locked into another dimension<br>you know<br>tell jerry garcia smoking opium wasn’t addicted<br>addictive he moved to<br>smoking black tar heroin after that<br>well it’s for sure<br>dig they still have opium dens back in the wild west<br>don’t you remember sure<br>but<br>I never once did opi and the next day thought about<br>oh my god I needed<br>you know it was never like that<br>cocaine was kind of like that but for me<br>but hope it never was like that<br>that was more of like a treat like a dessert<br>well you know that’s a<br>good argument because this argument was on<br>the message board as well<br>people were talking about things being addictive and<br>the problem with even<br>alcohol being addictive is that it’s not addictive<br>to everybody you know I’m not addicted to alcohol<br>I could not have a drink every<br>day for the rest of my life<br>and I’d have no problem with that<br>but I like to have a drink sometimes and go on stage<br>I like to have a drink sometimes<br>my buddies just to make things fun<br>just makes you get crazy<br>you pay for it the next day though especially our age<br>yeah yeah man you get older you pay for it more<br>but the bottom line is it’s not a dick dude like<br>I don’t hurt when I don’t have it<br>but for some people it is<br>some people have to have a drink<br>when I was doing construction<br>when I was a kid<br>there was a dude who had a mountain dew bottle<br>and he would fill it up with fucking beer<br>just like cheat beer like kolt<br>45 and he would drink beer<br>all day while we worked all day<br>this guy was he was<br>shaky jones and dude he would show up for work though<br>he was there every fucking day seven in the morning<br>swinging that hammer<br>you know he was there<br>pissing every 5min guy was always hammered though<br>he was drinking beer all day for that dude though<br>I think it’s like everybody’s got their own biochemical<br>makeup it’s like you’re addicted to cigarettes<br>but like tom segura<br>tom segura smoke cigarettes when he drinks<br>but doesn’t smoke other times<br>and he can go years without cigarettes<br>no problem<br>but when he dranks he likes to have a cigarette<br>when was the last time he went a year with no problem<br>though well he said he’s taken a long time off<br>he’s taken time off a bunch of times<br>and he won’t smoke for months<br>and then he’ll have a cigarette<br>he’ll have a cigarette when he drinks<br>I definitely think cigarettes is like that<br>one thing that even if you quit smoking<br>it could be three years later in out of nowhere<br>you’ll start smoking again<br>no reason why<br>no you said that and so is ari so I think<br>you know I think they’re doing something<br>remember that movie the insider with Russian crow<br>you see that movie<br>it’s all about all the shit that they do to cigarettes<br>to make it even more addictive<br>like hundreds of difference of additives<br>hundreds of different additives<br>just to make it more addictive<br>and<br>I totally believe that’s true<br>totally 100% believe that’s true<br>and if that’s the case<br>man I mean who the fuck knows<br>I mean they say that cigarettes are more<br>it’s not as dangerous as heroin<br>because heroin will kill you quicker<br>and you can overdose from it<br>but cigarettes will get you hooked<br>quicker than anything<br>yeah but apparently if you<br>if you have that thing inside<br>you that gets you hooked to shit<br>like mostly but I don’t<br>but I cigarettes totally different<br>totally the only one cocaine too you said<br>well I almost because I was<br>selling it and getting a large amount of it for free<br>you were allegedly allegedly selling<br>not really selling not really selling<br>this is just for 5th<br>this is like a character<br>that would buy a large amount so he could give it away<br>and it had some extra for free<br>it was peter pan of<br>no not peter pan robin hood of cocaine<br>it was like one month of my life back in 90<br>in this fictional story in his fictional story<br>but anyways if you but if you were rich okay<br>what if you were like rich<br>rich what if you like jay z baller you know<br>private jet rich and you could just get pure cocaine<br>shipped right over here from the cia the cia<br>would drop it off on your doorstep<br>well I think I like the trico package of cocaine<br>I think the only reason<br>it was kind of addictive to me because I am one<br>of those people<br>that never go to the doctors<br>and I probably<br>need to be one of those people that are on<br>speed or something<br>because I like having a firework<br>I like having a firework condition<br>most of my day is spent like moping around<br>no energy and stuff like that<br>but<br>when cocaine I felt like I was alive for the first time<br>and I think that’s what was addictive<br>more of just like<br>I felt like I was out of some kind of coma<br>well sometimes yeah<br>well sometimes I’m having like a normal day<br>like I’m not really into anything<br>and I’ll have a cup of coffee and god damn<br>it fucking fired up<br>I feel great yeah I feel good about life<br>right fucking feels like the warm sun feels better<br>I want to clean my office right<br>you get a little fired up from stimulants you know<br>right that’s what they’re there for<br>yeah you know<br>I don’t know what cocaine’s like<br>but I know that I’ve had<br>you would never stop talking<br>ever did you talk about this<br>how much I did that tea once<br>you would be talking so fast<br>your jaw would fly off and hit somebody in the face<br>I have this thing called matte dakoka and<br>it’s a tea that’s made out of<br>I guess I’m talking to myself for now<br>I’m talking to you<br>matti de coco is a tea that’s made out of<br>coca leaves so it’s like cocaine<br>the plant that they make cocaine from<br>but it’s the unprocessed form<br>which is<br>it’s actually like indigenous people<br>chew that I think it’s in Peru<br>they said it’s like really common isn’t it Peru<br>he isn’t always outside smoking cigarettes<br>talk about myself<br>they chew this leaf<br>for especially people that<br>are at high altitude<br>like high altitude herding communities<br>they eat this<br>they chew this tea<br>this tea leaf<br>but I had it in a tea form and when I had it it was<br>not good for me<br>I couldn’t shut the fuck up<br>me and doug stanhope were doing shrooms<br>it was the day the Iraq war started<br>and we were in the middle of the desert at my friend<br>yon’s house and it’s pretty crazy because we’re<br>shroomin and right when the shrooms were kicking in<br>we noticed on the television set that<br>they were saying that the war coverage begins at five<br>and stanhope looked at me and he goes<br>there’s a fucking kickoff for the war<br>I mean that’s really what it was like<br>they were telling us when the war<br>coverage was gonna start<br>tune in and five<br>or war coverage<br>it was like a kickoff<br>it was like<br>that’s when the program the war program was gonna<br>start and<br>that’s when this guy yon my friend yon who’s like<br>he’s done more<br>psychedelics than anyone I’ve ever met ever<br>he’s definitely probably fried his brain<br>he’s got a cool podcast though<br>but he was<br>talking about hey take this mate to cocoa it’ll help<br>the mushrooms kick in quicker<br>maybe it did but I could not shut the fuck up<br>and I was telling doug while I was doing it<br>I was like I can’t shut the fuck up<br>this has drive me crazy and he was<br>laughing uncontrollably<br>because he thought it was hilarious that I was<br>talking about how I couldn’t shut the fuck up yet<br>aware of it and still talking<br>it’s the worst but you know what<br>that’s one of those drugs that thank god<br>you never tried because<br>you would freak out and love it because<br>it makes your mind open up and just think so clear<br>because you’re just<br>non stop thinking of new stuff to talk about<br>that’s for me<br>my friend jimmy said that when we were kids<br>we had the cousin that was had the problem with it<br>he told me not to do it he told you smell so bad dude<br>that is so nasty<br>cigarettes are so far nasty<br>but you<br>kept on talking about him and daddy needed a taste<br>oh daddy needed a taste you can’t go 2h with that<br>he had a cigarette right when we started<br>two by the other half oh<br>shut your fucking hole<br>you had your fix<br>had your goddamn fix<br>anyway cigarette’s bad m k m k<br>very bad m k you know what though<br>what’s interesting in California<br>I don’t know if this is<br>in all states that they have changed cigarettes<br>to go out by themselves now<br>so if you don’t hit it long enough<br>it will just go out because of the fires out here<br>so cigarette companies had to make something<br>in the cigarette<br>so if you don’t<br>hit it after a while it will go out by itself<br>and just makes me what is that<br>yeah that can’t be good they’ve<br>been doing something like that man<br>they’ve probably made it extra addictive along the way<br>oh it’s just well we can do that<br>but unfortunately<br>cause a psychotic episode is<br>to make you fucking mortgage your house<br>for extra cigarettes<br>you might start hoarding cigarettes<br>you know if they could figure out a way<br>to put something<br>in cigarettes that would make you<br>completely insane and<br>have this insane desire to collect cigarettes<br>could you imagine if that started happening you know<br>a lot of black dudes collect sneakers<br>have like you go into their house I got<br>you know mtv wraps or mtv cribs<br>rather you know you go in<br>they have like a whole room filled with sneakers<br>they’re hiding their junk from somebody<br>their junk was touched or its mouth<br>it’s too big and they think it have a<br>horse cock so they want you to look at the shoes<br>what is he talking about is like the shoes no<br>no<br>no they’re just<br>for whatever reason they’re into collecting shoes<br>what if people just started collecting cigarettes<br>like cording cigarettes like roomfuls of cigarettes<br>and cigarette companies were like well<br>you know we make a fantastic product<br>we can’t help it<br>if people get excited about it<br>they’re just excited about our product<br>and we found out that they had added something<br>to cigarettes that make people<br>want to hoard cigarettes<br>they would totally do it<br>if some fucking scientist came up with<br>a formula<br>where he could have a certain amount of chemicals<br>and if you put those in cigarettes and people<br>smoke the cigarettes<br>they would have this<br>insatiable desire to collect cigarettes<br>and buy way more than they need<br>you don’t think they would put that in the cigarettes<br>of course they would<br>fuck yeah they would do it<br>they don’t give a fuck about you<br>they sell shit that kills you<br>they shit they don’t<br>it’s not like they didn’t know<br>we didn’t know cigarettes kill you<br>holy shit we’re gonna stop<br>we’re sorry no<br>cigarettes kill 400 fucking million people every year<br>and no cigarette companies have even thought about<br>slowing down<br>and no politicians have ever thought about banning them<br>you never hear a peep out of politicians<br>all those<br>faggots want to talk about fucking banning pot<br>and you know we’ve<br>got to stop marijuana and illegal drugs<br>meanwhile<br>cigarettes are killing way more people than everything<br>else combined<br>cancer aids fucking heroin math coke all that shit<br>pull it all together with alcohol<br>it can’t put a fucking dent<br>not a scratch into its cigarettes kill every year<br>if they can figure out a way<br>to make you want a horde cigarettes for sure<br>they would do it<br>and the people hoarding it they would give testimonials<br>I don’t have a problem with it<br>I enjoy<br>my cigarette collection when I walk into the garage<br>and I look at all my I like the smell I get out there<br>and I mean it’s not like I’m smoking more<br>I smoke the smell smoke today<br>you’re right they do do that with scars<br>but cigars are totally different<br>like to like saver the taste and shit<br>and it’s like shit makes no sense different now<br>different cigars have different flavors too<br>they taste different<br>yeah they all taste like shit to me<br>they all taste like you’re sucking on a fucking<br>I don’t know a tree or something<br>I like them I like cigars I think they taste good<br>really yeah when you have a fat steak<br>and a glass of wine<br>you get a nice cuban cigar<br>with a fucking good taste to it<br>you know it’s just like<br>you take it in you get a good taste of your mouth<br>it’s fun get your little gives you a buzz<br>crazy it’s weird that you don’t like buzz then<br>I don’t like spliffs because you don’t inhale cigars<br>you don’t have to inhale put it in your mouth<br>you do if you gonna get high<br>no the science between getting high<br>is that once it hits your mouth<br>immediately interstream you don’t even is that true<br>yeah they did<br>a study where it showed like people<br>that used to think where you’re supposed to inhale it<br>and holding it in as long as you can<br>I guess suppose that you get 99% of the thc immediately<br>when you suck it<br>Twitter verse is this true<br>because if this is true<br>I will stop smoking weed from now on<br>and I’ll just put it in my mouth<br>I’ll just put it in my mouth<br>take a deep breath and then blow it out<br>I always thought the people were doing that were like<br>bill clinton I always thought that<br>bill clinton did not inhale<br>but it’s because he was crafty<br>he didn’t know that he knows the science<br>he knows the science is that real science<br>it is science<br>is that real science Twitter verse<br>what the fuck is that true<br>you don’t let’s keep our googling right now<br>I love google<br>we’re going to google right now<br>you do not have to inhale marijuana to get high<br>an air water to get high<br>yeah<br>I always thought you had to hold it in for the long<br>thing too<br>but wiki answers<br>what if you do not inhale marijuana<br>answer no<br>it has to go in your lungs to get you high<br>meaning you have to inhale to get high<br>well I’m not gonna listen this stupid fuck<br>because this stupid fuck spelled high right<br>two different times and then wrote have<br>in capital letters<br>not very scientific faggot<br>next try<br>here’s the trip do you have to inhale when smoking weed<br>Yahoo answers uh<br>don’t do it best answer chosen by asker<br>you fucking dummy<br>this is what the girl says<br>uh don’t do it<br>but if you must know<br>you have to keep this smoke in your<br>lungs longer than you normally would<br>a cigarette so<br>you inhale it and then keep it in there for as long<br>as you can then exhale<br>that’s not true<br>that’s not true<br>this is dumb contou uh don’t do it<br>why alyssa because you don’t want to have fun<br>why should he not smoke the pop<br>because he doesn’t want to be friendly<br>because he doesn’t want to be more sensitive<br>because he wants it<br>doesn’t want to tune into the universe more<br>shut the fuck up<br>don’t do it<br>you can’t tell me not to smug pot<br>because I’m a goddamn comedian<br>and that’s like telling a basketball player to not<br>play with basketballs<br>mmm I can’t find the answer this shit<br>yeah I forget where I read it I read it somewhere<br>it was like you read at the same<br>way at place I read that<br>gold is the same amount of weed I know<br>no because<br>I was on your side where that’s bullshit<br>and my girlfriend who’s going to school for nursing<br>she’s like that’s totally untrue<br>and then she showed me all these studies<br>I’m like oh okay it was a<br>you have to if she’s watching from the weed to get high<br>like I do let’s say<br>this guy says you need to fully inhaling to get high<br>take a big breath in<br>see these are people like fucking evolves<br>you have to inhale weed in your lungs<br>get higher won’t do anything<br>weed does not cause cancer okay<br>this guy’s got a cancer article<br>when I’ll talk about crancy fuck<br>all right<br>we have no correct answer ladies and gentlemen we tried<br>we cannot find the answer to this<br>Yahoo answers are all written by 16 year olds<br>or<br>40 year old retards one or the other<br>this guy says he knows everything about canos<br>more in 7 seconds<br>all right these guys<br>Yahoo answers yeah we looked at those Yahoo answers<br>man that doesn’t mean shit<br>it’s something about your mouth it’s filled with<br>whatever the makes sense because you don’t inhale<br>tobacco smoke when you<br>smoke a cigar and you get high as fuck<br>you get really high from cigars<br>cigars give you like a serious nicotine rush<br>like whoo like a good one<br>and if that’s if that happens<br>why wouldn’t that happen<br>with marijuana too<br>you know you don’t inhale the cigar<br>smoke you take into your mouth<br>and then you blow it out<br>you don’t take a deep<br>hit of it like you do with cigarettes<br>yeah that’s a tough google search<br>I’ll have to just actually<br>find that yeah we don’t know<br>we don’t know ladies and gentlemen<br>it was a recent article that was about six months ago<br>I read it<br>some people weed is not for them that really is true<br>you know like stanhop doesn’t like weed<br>stanhope hates weed<br>which doesn’t make any sense cause he likes everything<br>else but<br>I think he probably got too high and he got paranoid<br>if you get too high weed will fucking rock your world<br>man shit makes you really<br>the last ufc I was at I was tripping my ass off<br>I almost had to run out<br>I was thinking like okay<br>I am just going to leave<br>and go to my room and take a nap<br>because I was tripping too hard<br>from weed wow this is a rivalry says opium trivia<br>the term are you hip comes from opium dens<br>you would lay on your side on your hip and smoke<br>hence the term are you hip<br>that kind of makes sense<br>because if you ever watch like those old west movies<br>or dudes are doing heroin<br>or opium they are lying on their side<br>yeah like what was that movie where wyatt herb was it<br>wyatt herb<br>one of those movies buffalo bill or wyatt herb<br>I think was<br>I don’t remember who the fuck played him<br>well remember<br>what was the movie where a dock holiday<br>the one was fucking<br>dennis quade played<br>dennis quade played wide herb<br>and val kilmer played doc holiday the dopas doc holiday<br>before val kilmer just ate everything<br>that existed val kilmer is all fat fucked up now<br>he was like go back to top gun days<br>tombstone tombstone that’s it<br>we go back to like val kilmer like the old days<br>val kilmer was a handsome motherfucker<br>you know<br>you start hanging out with tom size warren<br>you know this whole wheat thing<br>we could just fucking next time we’re sober we’ll just<br>try it<br>yeah<br>ooh okay look at this guy says red band is right<br>arrow it here we go<br>robberies comes clean oh here we go<br>you do not read it to us<br>okay here it is<br>mouth smoking cannabis<br>one of the primary health issues with<br>cannabis is the effect of smoke of the lungs<br>while the risk<br>from long term cannabis smoking<br>are not fully understood is assumed by<br>before I do this<br>I will tell<br>I will take this copy<br>mount smoking is not as efficient as long smoking<br>and requires approximately three times the material<br>for the same level of effect<br>but for some people efficiency is not an issue<br>I would say it’s not an issue<br>you know cause<br>weeds not that expensive as you know like<br>we were talking about how it’s worth a lot of money<br>because but it’s not worth it’s not that much<br>I mean<br>one marijuana joint is like what is it like<br>$10 or something like that probably<br>was it how much is a joint<br>a joint<br>$10 about $10 but that’s at California a joint will<br>that’s for sure<br>fuck you out of your mind<br>even if you<br>even if you smoke a lot<br>if you actually inhaled<br>a full joint you would be bullets greed<br>California weed<br>California weed<br>so if you take California weed and you mouth<br>mouth fuck it right<br>you could probably<br>get by unlike it’s a two hits<br>of California weed from a joint and you’re gone<br>and one of the things that you could do also<br>is if you inhale it and you<br>free that out your nose so<br>you put it in your mouth and then you<br>below it out your nose<br>but you’re not killing it<br>it even increases it all right<br>well let’s post this up online just so everybody knows<br>what the fuck we’re reading<br>yeah but I used to I remember<br>there was somebody I used to know that would like smoke<br>she would only smoke with me but she would sit<br>I’m not gonna inhale it<br>but I’ll smoke it with you it makes you feel better<br>I’m like ha ha ha okay<br>so<br>she would always get fucked up<br>and I’m like wow she’s<br>not stoned but why is she acting so fucked up<br>so I look back at it now she was fucked up okay<br>I just put that shit up online<br>so you get Twitter that<br>so now we learn something ladies and gentlemen thanks<br>rivalries<br>rivalries you know a lot of drugs motherfucker<br>this is the dude he runs the whole thing<br>it says he owns a poohol in<br>somewhere in Georgia<br>forget where it’s from<br>make them make them george I believe<br>but it’s a pretty famous pool hall this guy owns it<br>why does he have the douche squad<br>I don’t know it’s a bunch of dudes at the douche squad<br>you know some members of my board break off<br>into little separate sex<br>like little gangs<br>little gangs don’t know what they’re doing<br>if you never been to my message board<br>I got the craziest message board<br>I don’t know how the fuck happened<br>I don’t know what caused it<br>but I’ve had this nutty message board<br>since like nineteen ninety eight<br>and right now there is<br>more than two and a half million posts on it<br>I’ll put it up online<br>I started smoking when I was 15 ray<br>and anyway this message board<br>there’s so much fucking nutty shit on that board<br>that’s how I met brian<br>I met brian from the message board<br>it’s really got a life of its own<br>I mean it’s got my name attached to it<br>and I pay for it and to keep it running and you know<br>but there’s like a bunch of different dudes who are<br>cool people that I’ve met in real life<br>most of them that are<br>the moderators on the board and you know it’s anything<br>fucked up in the world<br>anything weird crazy any nutty news<br>if you’re looking for a video<br>like I heard this is a crazy video out<br>my board is gonna have it for sure right<br>when you say that’s looks<br>yeah it’s a crazy place<br>it’s pretty nutty ladies gentlemen<br>and on that note it’s fucking five thirty six<br>yeah that’s 2h 2min and a half hours<br>we can’t do more in 2h folks get boring<br>but we are at the addison Texas improv this weekend<br>Friday Saturday and Sunday<br>and I’m gonna take a link right here<br>motherfucker and I’m gonna open this bitch<br>and I’m gonna put that on Twitter<br>so everybody knows what’s up<br>almost sold out<br>yeah it is very close to sold out like all the shows<br>what about Houston<br>a lot of Houston people<br>wondering if you’re coming back to you<br>yeah I’m coming back<br>we’re right now<br>trying to figure out whether we’re doing the improv<br>or whether we’re doing the house of blues<br>there was a problem with the house of blues initially<br>where they said the house of blues could not<br>seat everybody<br>and I did not want to do a show where people have to<br>stand and we talked about this before that<br>we went to the doug stan help show when he was in la<br>and I loved doug<br>but I<br>fucking can’t stand<br>and just watch a show for an hour and a half<br>it just hurts your feet<br>your back starts hurting your neck gets cramped up<br>and then I realize like this is uncomfortable<br>like sitting and watching a show is awesome<br>but standing and watching a show sucks it gets annoying<br>not a big fan of the house of blues<br>I just went through to see a concept last week<br>and I had a horrible experience for those fuckers<br>with house of blues which one though the one on sunset<br>what happened<br>when you go through<br>they stamp your hands they put<br>wristbands on<br>they check your ids they scan the tickets right<br>so when you went there and it was general emission<br>we found a place that we wanted to like sit and<br>like lean up against the wall<br>it was perfect for the concert<br>halfway through the opening<br>act or whatever opening band security<br>grabbing my girlfriend coming out of the bathroom goes<br>where’s your hand stamp<br>she goes I don’t know maybe it washed off<br>I have a wristband here’s my ticket<br>he goes no your hands not stamped you’re out of here<br>and she’s like what<br>I have my ticket right here and he goes<br>I don’t care he’s supposed to have a handstand<br>she goes my boyfriend’s right there<br>and he goes go get him and he’s kicked out too<br>and like it was like<br>what are you okay but that’s just la douchebag<br>no no but then the manager got involved right<br>but that has nothing to do with<br>Houston Texas or no no<br>you’ve been losing the clues as a company yeah it is<br>all right<br>corporate policy you’re supposed to get hands stamped<br>I’m like it doesn’t matter<br>I’m in here I have tickets<br>what the fucking does manage you guys<br>I’m sorry but let’s go downstairs<br>let’s get your hand stamp<br>let’s figure this out together<br>I’m like the concert’s on right now<br>god damn it was just like the biggest<br>like fucking corporate bullshit<br>you know that shit wouldn’t happen at fucking improv<br>you don’t think so no<br>you don’t have your hand stamp but you have a ticket<br>come on<br>so you think that that<br>so what happened then you think would not happen<br>so you think it did<br>if we have a show at the house of blues<br>people might get fucked<br>my problem with the house of blues<br>it’s a corporate thing<br>the whole not being a<br>great fucking time at all the house of blues<br>yeah well you have any time when you’re at in front of<br>a good crowd of people<br>right yeah<br>but that’s one of the few<br>venues where you guarantee that everything’s gonna run<br>smoothly you know they get rid of douchebags<br>in the audience there’s not a record your own set<br>that is true now that<br>fans aren’t allowed to bring cameras into the place<br>or they have to leave them at the box office<br>well the problem with that is these motherfuckers<br>want to stick<br>cameras in your face while you’re on stage<br>and constantly record things<br>and put them on YouTube<br>they’re going to do that<br>very destroyed<br>they’re going to do that regardlessly<br>but it is annoying for them and for the bands and for<br>different people who feel like they don’t want<br>their stuff pirated<br>they’re just protecting the artist<br>that makes sense to me<br>I agree but it’s<br>you had a bad experience<br>but I think he had isolated douchebags<br>I mean people run the house of blues in<br>in vegas or fucking awesome<br>those people are super cool<br>that’s the one we go to the most<br>yeah house of blues in san diego<br>that we also do is a performance side not a customer<br>that’s true I’ve never heard any complaints<br>so if you guys have had complaints<br>about the house of blues let them nigga know<br>you know I<br>need to hear that shit<br>maybe dan ackroyd’s house of blues in<br>connecticut at the mohegan sun<br>deal fell through gigantic fail<br>why did I read that<br>you fucking<br>motherfucker<br>house of blues charges a buttler that is true<br>they have a lot of built in costs<br>it costs I get paid the same amount<br>to do a 300 seat room in vegas<br>as I do to do the house of blues<br>or just like 900 seats<br>which is pretty crazy<br>yeah that’s fucked up yeah that’s kind of fucked up<br>it’s because they have all these built in<br>they have built in costs<br>in their built in pockets<br>oh shit built in pocket yeah in their prices<br>that’s another thing<br>the prices were ridiculous<br>like a bud light with six box or something like that<br>is it really<br>yeah where is it in what is it in most bars<br>bud light usually I mean how it’s out of<br>Los angeles usually it’s like three bucks<br>two bucks for a bud light outside of Los angeles<br>yeah in Los angeles in Los angeles under $5 at least<br>okay well someone just fucking bitch slap rivalries<br>bbj jones says that<br>shit we said about hip the opium dens<br>he says<br>the actual<br>is<br>to<br>the answer of<br>are you hip being opium dens lying on<br>he says it’s not true it’s not true<br>it says too ingenious too convoluted and too silly<br>wiki 44 but that’s wiki this is this is just opinion<br>there’s often a great deal about<br>certainly in tracking word origins<br>since we have written<br>words record to go on<br>phrase may have been in common use<br>long before anybody wrote it down<br>after all<br>one doesn’t use slang phrases in most writing<br>such as newspaper<br>a certain columnist accepted<br>they should use<br>slang and everything<br>that’s how we talk<br>why we pretended to not talk the way we talk<br>I always thought that like<br>writing professionally<br>like when I write in my blogs<br>I write exactly the way I talk<br>which is like I wrote an open letter to kelloggs<br>which more or less I did as a writing exercise<br>I was writing every day<br>for a month<br>the month my spike tv special was being recorded<br>so I wrote down<br>I wrote my material out every day<br>I not wrote them material<br>I wrote new blogs every day and<br>I just needed shit to write about<br>and one of them was this<br>kellogg’s<br>banning michael phelps because he smoked weed<br>and because I wrote this open letter<br>and I wrote it the way I talk<br>with swears and just the way I normally talk<br>people like yeah<br>they’re gonna read that open letter like<br>I didn’t want him to read it stupid<br>I’m just writing it doesn’t<br>you can read it or you don’t read it<br>but I’m not gonna write something<br>you do have more impact just like they’re gonna listen<br>they’re gonna listen to a fucking<br>podhead comedian<br>cage fighting commentator like kelloggs is gonna make<br>their decisions based on that<br>no it’s for you guys<br>it’s for humor it’s for entertainment<br>does the word hip really<br>hail from a west african language<br>it could be either or though this<br>this I mean it could be<br>that that<br>the original hip that rivalries talked about is right<br>I mean this I mean if there’s no real<br>if the origins of it are<br>murky it could be it could be both<br>it’s not saying anything to discredit that<br>anyway okay so fuck<br>red band is totally right about the cigars<br>oh is he really<br>totally right<br>I am totally right<br>no no it’s a fucking taste thing<br>I think cigarettes are disgusting<br>and you’re sucking on them every day<br>so you wouldn’t think they’re disgusting<br>if you smoke them for a week<br>yeah you’re totally right about that<br>you’re right<br>if I was a junkie I wouldn’t think they’re disgusting<br>this guy had a shitty experience<br>at the anaheim house of blues<br>same deal as red band except<br>they had to make
