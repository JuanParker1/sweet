gentlemen<br>tardy but here nonetheless<br>sort of it’s like halfway through because<br>the the one on u stream says 3:00 and this one says<br>and I said it 2:00 because I’m an idiot<br>but it’s supposed to be 3:00 so we figure we’ll start<br>somewhere around now<br>it’s all about<br>checking out the Twitter that I defined out when really<br>shit’s going on<br>well that’s ridiculous<br>burn because some people have lives<br>and they can’t just be on the fucking Twitter<br>all the time looking for you to do shit<br>have you met people that have their Twitter setup<br>so when people twit<br>they automatically get like a text message<br>yeah that’s retarded<br>I don’t know people get mad at me<br>sometimes you mean you’re tweeting too much<br>man it’s blowing up my phone I have to take you off<br>yeah that’s ridiculous why would you have<br>I think maybe<br>in the beginning<br>it was almost like an instant message for people<br>you know yeah like or not<br>but it really that’s just text messaging<br>that’s someone who you know text messaging<br>but text messaging to all their friends right<br>and then it got crazy<br>you know<br>it’s a strange way of communicating man<br>Twitter is one of the weirdest fucking inventions<br>that the internet has ever spurned<br>spurned sperm word spurring give birth to shit out<br>it’s amazing<br>it’s just it’s so simple keep it to 140 characters<br>so that<br>you know you don’t get too fucking verbose and stupid<br>you learn how to edit your shit you know<br>you can’t have these long<br>run on you ever read someone’s blogs<br>and even my own blogs ramble so much<br>too much sometimes<br>some people<br>your blogs are for smart people that you know<br>like like readers like I have to be in a reader mode<br>yeah you know like<br>most of the time I’m in more of a video<br>me too I don’t want to read people bullshit<br>I don’t want to read anything like I write<br>but it’s<br>sometimes I do<br>I think and when I have<br>to write it I have to write it whatever though<br>if I’m writing something<br>it’s just because that’s what I’m thinking about<br>and I’ve been fucking with it and I’ve been<br>rolling around in my head<br>you know and they might not be correct<br>I have no idea<br>most of my ideas are just pure speculation<br>but the only way to really<br>be honest about it is to write it in a blog<br>you can’t like tell people stuff like that<br>you start talking to people<br>about your theories and you saw your nut<br>but at least if you write it down for whatever reason<br>it looks more thought out<br>yeah isn’t that weird<br>you know<br>have you just tell people that you think that<br>technology some sort of a symbiotic light<br>form that’s existing with us<br>and eventually it’s gonna overcome us<br>and then everybody’s looking at it like<br>we control it always<br>you know no no<br>like those terminator movies those guys got it right<br>like that’s like super possible<br>it really is I mean<br>no one wants to believe it<br>but if you look at how fucking chaotic human life is<br>and not<br>not really in america<br>you know this is a pretty badass country<br>but if you watch like documentaries on like<br>that vice squad<br>guide to Liberia is that what it was<br>what is the<br>the website that did we talk about that last week<br>what was it about those vice tv guys<br>those guys that go to Liberia<br>and talk<br>about all the cannibalism and shit that’s going on<br>there seems like you did<br>I think we did talk about it<br>yeah if you haven’t seen it<br>well I’m gonna<br>find the link and throw it up anyway<br>because it’s so crazy<br>here is that link also that you<br>talked about last<br>week that somebody said that you didn’t<br>did you ever<br>which they were like this link’s not working<br>a lot of people were like<br>forget what it was about<br>maybe the lions that you were talking about the lions<br>last week that the ampt up<br>oh yeah really<br>that was the wrong way<br>maybe it was that one there was a few there was<br>I just remember because somebody said that they saw it<br>it was amazing maybe they<br>googled it or something<br>maybe yeah maybe they were smart<br>they’re like oh maybe we should use google<br>if we’re talking about something<br>I’ll give you the wrong link<br>let me know I’m sorry<br>that’s that is annoying<br>we try and figure out what it is<br>yeah but most of the time google works out pretty well<br>don’t you feel like a little<br>genius when you figure out where they fucked up though<br>you go back to the url and you go<br>oh there’s including the bottom part of that<br>and you gotta<br>copy and paste the whole thing and put in your browser<br>it’s like your little solves a little bit<br>a little puzzle that’s for you oh cool<br>that’s a papaya kombucha which it’s good for you<br>or is it mango<br>papaya keeping it real<br>what’s up Twitter people the fuck’s cracking huh<br>how’s life that lion shit was crazy<br>yeah if you haven’t seen what we’re talking about<br>with the lion shit<br>there was a these gigantic lions that lived<br>in africa<br>and they got cut off from the rest of the continent<br>and there was<br>stuck on an island<br>and there were like regular sized lines at first<br>they presume<br>and because they were on the island with only<br>water buffalo<br>water buffalo hard as fuck to kill<br>so these lines got gigantic<br>they grew fucking huge from taking down<br>water buffaloes<br>it’s really pretty fucking spooky stuff<br>mm hmm you know<br>it’s intense like<br>they looked like like the hulk<br>they didn’t look real like those mice yeah yeah<br>those mice that have that mile statin thing that they<br>like those dogs those whippets when they do those<br>experiments on them<br>and they make them look like cartoons<br>have you ever seen that<br>disease I guess it would be that<br>makes you grow fast<br>like they just showed this<br>woman that was 12 years old<br>but she looked like she was 62 and a smoker<br>yeah it’s not that<br>it has to do with the fat in your skin<br>it doesn’t have to do with growing fast<br>it has to do with the fat in your skin<br>when you get older<br>one of the things that happens is<br>the fat leaves your skin<br>and these people<br>who are like thirteen and twelve and little babies even<br>they have this disease where<br>that’s how their body like<br>starts treating it right away<br>so their skin starts to behave like an old person skin<br>whoa<br>it was weird though<br>I felt so bad for it because she was really<br>like and her mother had it too it’s terrible<br>super rare though so don’t worry about it<br>yeah but it’s pretty freaky when you<br>find diseases like that<br>you know but this Liberia shit man<br>if you haven’t seen this<br>I have to throw this link up because<br>it’s one of the<br>gnarliest fucking documentaries I’ve ever seen ever<br>and these guys<br>I think their shows called vice guide tv<br>yeah vice guide the library I’m gonna give you exactly<br>she watched the last last night<br>yes I did<br>without giving any spoilers what do you think<br>no spoilers no spoilers<br>I think<br>I’m getting tired of it<br>you are yeah so you didn’t find exciting last night<br>it was exciting but I was like come on<br>you just jump it back in time and<br>you know people are dead but then they’re not<br>and like come on really<br>yeah you know I’m saying it’s like really<br>that’s what’s going on now<br>well<br>when that one thing was the one thing and he was like<br>I’m sorry for being that thing<br>that was crazy yeah<br>but it was like<br>a certain point time I was like god damn<br>this is like comical<br>yeah it’s like it was caricature<br>you know what I really hated<br>also is how many commercials there were there were<br>like every 3min there was a commercial in the future<br>hopefully you could like go alright<br>no I don’t want commercials I want pop up ads on my tv<br>you know<br>pretty nutty because that was just like you were<br>into it out of it<br>into it out of it<br>yeah it is pretty nutty<br>yeah you gotta watch it on dvr and even then<br>you gotta fast forward through them<br>commercials are a very<br>inefficient way of reaching people<br>because you’re in the shit out<br>you know I mean it does if you stuff enough shit<br>down our throats we’ll eventually<br>take it but putting it on in the middle of like<br>shows and stuff like that<br>what if you could go to like a group<br>once a month for<br>like 10min and they just<br>showed you a bunch of products<br>and then they’re like all right<br>no more advertising for you<br>on the internet or for the tv<br>just because you<br>you know you went to like a<br>group meeting<br>just so<br>advertisers can sell their products to you in person<br>yeah you know what I mean like this is coke here<br>taste it yeah<br>all right so we won’t advertise your tv anymore<br>well I think there’s<br>maybe a better way would be to do it<br>the way they do it at the movies<br>where they show you the ads first<br>yeah and then the movie yeah but you have to watch it<br>that’s the thing now but still<br>it’s like once the show begins you shut the fuck up<br>right you know when you go to the movies the concede<br>what you’re conceding is that you give them money<br>so they’re only gonna annoy you in the beginning<br>and then they’re gonna stop annoying you<br>they’re gonna let the thing play out in its full form<br>which is the most enjoyable way<br>when you appreciate any<br>like<br>at a coca cola or any one of those people<br>just stepped in and said listen<br>we all know the tv shows are better<br>when you let them play from the beginning to end<br>you don’t want to interrupt them with commercial<br>all the time<br>how about we’ll do this<br>we’ll advertise the beginning thank you very much<br>I hope you enjoy our product<br>hope you enjoy this movie<br>bam yeah<br>that’s how it’s supposed to be yeah<br>they got it nailed these movie guys got it nailed<br>these tv guys were tarted<br>you’d be putting shit on the middle of the fucking show<br>stupid it was jump<br>yeah and it was so bad last night that I was just like<br>really this is getting<br>insane every 15min and come on<br>it wasn’t even 15min maybe<br>maybe every hour<br>if you’re gonna have a 2h show every hour<br>throw on a few commercials<br>fuck it it pretty much<br>was 1h or show<br>1h of commercials but they build it as a 2h event<br>yeah well<br>you know it’s a lot of money man it’s a lot of money<br>I wasn’t<br>I really enjoyed the series up until now<br>especially early on<br>I felt it was<br>it’s like a really creative series<br>but I gotta admit that last<br>night just seems kind of like hokey<br>it’s like<br>you know the Chinese guy who doesn’t like this<br>oh I don’t want to say anything right<br>no yes you got to replace everything<br>blah blah blah blah blah I’m not no spoilers<br>I don’t want to give it away if you haven’t seen it<br>so that’s what I think<br>it’s still a great show<br>still I mean even though it seems hokey it’s still fun<br>but at a certain point time the whole premise is hokey<br>I mean come on it’s silly<br>it’s ridiculous it’s a suspension of disbelief show<br>yeah you know<br>you jumping back in time with nuclear weapons<br>what the fuck you doing<br>you know what<br>you can just hit that thing and you go back in time<br>oh okay cool<br>you know yeah<br>it’s just utter nonsense<br>it’s like I want to<br>I want to talk about it<br>but there’s something I want to talk about about<br>I’m trying to censor it but I there’s no way to do it<br>yeah you can’t<br>you can’t well<br>how did you did you enjoy it<br>yeah I did I was so pissed off about the commercials<br>that kind of upset me and I was very upset<br>I like being in a world<br>and not imagine watching avatar in every<br>5min you gotta take commercial<br>no you’re absolutely right<br>it’s ridiculous<br>there’s got to be a better way to sell shit<br>yeah that’s not the best way to sell shit that’s stupid<br>yeah they think that just by you know<br>by conditioning people to be used to<br>interrupting it over and over again<br>that’s the best way make us watch it in the beginning<br>yeah they’re like we’re not gonna watch it anyway<br>then you have a webcam<br>setup on top of your tv that detects if you’re<br>sitting there watching it<br>you know yeah<br>people get excited for previews<br>man I get excited for the whole preview<br>I don’t know why<br>but I get excited I’m more amped up<br>to see the wolf man this year than I think<br>like anything<br>man that looks awesome<br>can you do it<br>that’s gonna be like a new gang sign<br>dude do the wolf man<br>dude it looks sick<br>it looks cool because it’s like old school the wolf man<br>you know and that rick baker did all the makeup<br>he’s that<br>dude who did star wars and he’s done like everything<br>he did an american werewolf in London and this is like<br>real old school makeup<br>you know it’s not like cgi like parts or cgi<br>like the transformation<br>is cgid when it becomes the wolfman<br>but then it’s like a dude in an outfit<br>you know and rick bakers the master that shit<br>when I was<br>a little kid I used to want to be a makeup artist<br>I used to want really those Hollywood guys that made<br>did you do the makeup of the guy on the hog video<br>how dare you but I used to want to do like<br>werewolf masks and shit and<br>like special effects movie special effects mask stuff<br>I thought that was the coolest shit ever<br>I wanted to do that for a while<br>man I was a big fan of that guy rick baker<br>he’s the dude<br>he’s doing this movie<br>too so this movie’s gonna be the shit<br>yeah it looks good<br>fuck it that’s like benicia del toro’s a badass<br>there’s a probably part where he sings like a wolf man<br>song or something like that<br>benicio del toro can act as fucking ass off that dude<br>you know he’s one of those dudes like<br>when he’s playing like angry or crazy<br>like he goes so far<br>you would worry that he’s gonna like<br>you’d worry he’s gonna do something fucking crazy<br>you know<br>now when he’s in a role<br>he’s one of those dudes it’s like<br>I always look forward to his movies like<br>whatever it is he knows how to do it<br>acting such a tricky thing<br>you know isn’t it like some actors you like<br>really look forward to seeing him in movies<br>you know yeah definitely it’s a weird thing<br>yeah<br>sisty spacestick<br>some dude’s getting like super obsessed with it<br>how about like those guys<br>guys are like super obsessed with movies<br>movie trivian shit<br>you know what’s really gay is that gross<br>is that there’s a gench<br>a volta movie<br>that’s coming out where it’s a love story<br>and it uses a cross movie reference<br>that’s how bad it is<br>he’s like imparison goes<br>I always like a roy island with cheese and I’m like oh<br>no well yeah oh my god it was like oh<br>that’s gross gench a volta seems to be losing his mind<br>I would love to talk to<br>that how dare he ruined a character<br>you know what I mean<br>he’s not ruining and then he’s creating a new one<br>I don’t think he’s ruining it you can’t ruin it<br>what it is is<br>a slice of time<br>and now you go back and you can see it<br>that’s as gross as commercials to me<br>well he was good in that pal in 123 movie<br>if you didn’t see that pal in 123 movie<br>here was fucking good in it<br>man he plays a good psycho<br>anybody didn’t like is the hurt locker<br>have you seen that<br>I didn’t see it run it on amazon I already have it<br>I already have it I got it<br>everybody says it’s the best movie ever<br>it’s so slow and boring it’s like<br>hey let’s go to one mission oh don’t say anymore<br>no no this is not really nothing<br>go to one mission oh let’s go to another mission<br>oh let’s go to another mission that end<br>like it’s like why am I watching this<br>like I felt like I was just watching you know what<br>I felt like that with<br>no country for old men<br>yeah I never saw that<br>no country for old men is like listen<br>I know what you’re trying to do<br>I know you’re trying to be crafty<br>I know you’re trying to be unconventional<br>but here’s the deal<br>when I go to movies<br>I want you to stick with the fucking framework<br>okay right here’s good<br>guys and bad guys and maybe monsters okay<br>and at the end good guys win any questions okay<br>make your shit okay I like watching good guys win<br>you fucking weirdo<br>I don’t watch<br>I don’t like watching people just drive off<br>the whole thing’s fake<br>all right<br>are you pretending that well in the real world<br>things will turn out<br>well this isn’t the real world stupid<br>this is a goddamn fucking movie<br>and I want a good ending right<br>I want an interesting ending with a fucking conclusion<br>avatar avatar<br>I’ve talked to so many gut people<br>that have been in the military that are<br>pissed off at that movie for killing<br>what they say represents u<br>s soldiers<br>but yet nowhere in there did they say they’re like us<br>or anything they’re just an army you know<br>that’s a good point<br>really when you think about yeah<br>they’re mad like well they say who are<br>whatever that no<br>well the one guy who was a fucking marine<br>but he was well a blue guy<br>I can see it I can see it but<br>it’s like all right dude<br>calm down their smurfs you know<br>yeah but well that’s this<br>he’s got a point man<br>you could see it that way because you’re not<br>a military right<br>that’s what I’m saying<br>I especially a military person<br>in the middle of two wars that they may not support<br>yeah there’s a lot of people<br>that are in the military<br>they don’t think we should be there anymore right<br>a lot of people<br>yeah but I think avatar<br>in general is just like it was like gi joe<br>you know it wasn’t real us army troops<br>you know there’s no reason to get mad<br>they’re just an army<br>they’re representing like a space army or something<br>yeah it was so much in future it was like<br>1000 year old man<br>it was too<br>human like if you want to be real yeah but it’s like<br>predator<br>I don’t think you don’t get mad predator yeah but<br>could you imagine though for real<br>if there was such a planet and there was<br>such a mineral and there were<br>mercenaries who were going to that planet<br>if it wasn’t broadcast to us<br>we don’t know what the fuck is going on in afghanistan<br>every day we don’t know about these<br>crazy drones their fire and missiles into Pakistan<br>I mean this is real stuff that’s on the news<br>it seems like science fiction<br>this is going on every day in other parts of the world<br>and how that ain’t that much different man<br>it ain’t that much different<br>it’s people that don’t know people<br>jacking people for their shit<br>yeah you know<br>and that’s what’s going on right now<br>and that’s what was going on in the movie<br>it’s not that unrealistic<br>you know<br>in fact it might be<br>it might be generous<br>the idea that they would go so far as<br>to make artificial ones to try to be friends with them<br>really<br>more like kill him more like kill him<br>I mean that’s what people do<br>I mean that movie painted a much more<br>a much brighter picture of humanity<br>than the real humanity<br>the real humanity we’re not making like arab clones<br>and we’re operating them with remote control<br>to go in and infiltrate the taliban and go hey guys<br>like what’s strong with being american<br>maybe we can all be cool you know<br>like<br>you know<br>I mean if the United States government you know had<br>that kind of insight and innovation<br>into the human bonnie<br>could you imagine the kind of shit that they would do<br>they would just make<br>billions and billions of republicans<br>they would just start<br>cloning republicans in making them<br>and operating them with remote control<br>republican girls fucking all the important guys<br>getting all their deals past<br>just that’s what they would do<br>you’re shaking really<br>robot girl<br>that’s what they would do man<br>that’s an avatar for the real life if that if they<br>we don’t we’re not that nice<br>okay we’re not gonna make fake arabs<br>you know it’s not gonna happen<br>or fake whoever the fuck we’re fighting<br>we’re gonna figure out a reason<br>to convince everybody on this side<br>that those people are evil<br>that’s what we’ve always done<br>those people are evil and then we jack them<br>you know I mean it’s it’s fucking amazing at the<br>same game can go on<br>for so long and in this age of information<br>it can still be passed off as like<br>you know as the important thing to do<br>you know the important thing to do at a certain point<br>is to try to fucking help everybody<br>try to get all these countries to<br>chill the fuck out<br>but that’s never gonna happen<br>man because they live in somewhere that sucks<br>and when you live somewhere that really sucks<br>there’s a lot of goddamn conflict<br>you know that’s just a fact<br>they’ve got a terrible fucking role of the dice<br>and they’re living in a part of the world that stuck<br>hundreds and hundreds of years ago<br>they’ve got technology but they’ve got chaos and<br>you know it doesn’t<br>it’s just a mess they’ve been fighting forever<br>they’ve been fighting forever over there man<br>I mean that’s what they do<br>that’s what these fucking people do<br>in the middle east<br>war has been going on the middle east for so long<br>like you talked to israelis like due to<br>living israel like ari talks about a lot of time<br>those motherfuckers are hard<br>you know those people are different<br>you know those those people are experiencing war<br>on a daily basis<br>man that’s like a part of their their culture almost<br>you know it’s like this conflict has been<br>going on for so fucking long over there<br>and it’s almost impossible to see a way<br>without evolving without evolving<br>as a species<br>it’s almost impossible to see a way it’s going to end<br>it just keeps going<br>it doesn’t show any sign of letting up<br>you know if you looked at it as you know as a wave<br>you know<br>and you see the wave bouncing back and forth like<br>it doesn’t seem like it’s going away<br>it seems like there’s always some bullshit going down<br>as always this motherfucker is mad at that motherfucker<br>and he’s gonna launch bombs<br>and<br>it just it seems like it takes a little time off<br>and then it bounces right back<br>and palestine once they land back<br>and and<br>the settler is an old shit<br>someone got run over by a tank<br>you know it’s like it’s always there<br>this spring backing forth<br>violent tension is always there<br>and it’s like some’s got to be done<br>at the core of that shit<br>something’s gonna be done unless you you<br>I mean unless that’s what people really want<br>unless people what they really want is conflict<br>maybe that’s just human nature you know<br>that’s possible right<br>so avatar is nicer than people<br>bring it back around<br>avatar is nicer than people<br>I think I don’t think we would make fake people<br>to deal with our enemy<br>we would fucking kill him<br>so for people that say that that’s uhmep<br>people in the padlight<br>mercenaries man<br>that’s a that’s crazy job<br>those kinds of space mercenaries motherfucker<br>don’t you play doom<br>all right those dudes are serious<br>space mercenaries<br>that’s an excellent character<br>if you’re playing quick three<br>you know it’d be a space marine fuck yeah bitch<br>tough characters<br>so I have an eight year old poll<br>that was revisited recently<br>it was about pooping right yeah<br>poop standing or poops sitting<br>are wiping standing Austin<br>it’s pretty funny though it’s gain popularity again<br>do you wipe standing up or sitting down<br>we you know how I wipe motherfucker<br>we’ve talked about this<br>I know but I don’t think we’ve talked on this<br>oh<br>I stand up to wipe it to get a good goddamn wipe in<br>yeah I’ll tell you this<br>I was using those flushable wipes<br>mm hmm you know to keep my butt nice<br>and fresh and tightening<br>you got fifty-fifty it<br>those aren’t good man<br>you got fifty-fifty it no no no<br>even if you fifty-fifty<br>it the problem with those<br>wipes is can’t really flush them<br>oh yeah they’re not flushable<br>they’re real flushable<br>they call them flush and bowling but<br>I’ve had a podge in my house twice<br>that’s how stupid I yeah<br>those bitches<br>they pack up in your pipes you can’t flush them<br>you know how many are you using<br>like 15 I wipe my ass a lock to the wall

cities<br>you know where<br>people are going to be like what the fuck is that<br>wouldn’t you do it at night<br>yes<br>I would do that<br>but I guess it’s okay<br>so we do it when everyone could see it and is awake<br>or should we do it three in the morning<br>well that’s part of the evil or well plan<br>you know<br>the evil plan is that they sprayed right above them<br>they willingly<br>you know allow these politicians to control them<br>with a sprave from the sky<br>you know who really<br>really really believes that shit is prints<br>princes like crazy about chemtrails<br>he was like you know<br>so crazy we would all be in the ghetto<br>and everybody would be playing and having a good time<br>and then they started spraying that shit over our heads<br>and all sudden everybody was fighting<br>like why are we fighting<br>what’s it about like what<br>the fuck are you talking about<br>all right<br>people always fight there’s always violence like what<br>are you insane<br>any place where people are poor people are violent<br>shut the fuck up<br>like you really<br>think that they’re spraying shit from the sky<br>that’s making people in poor communities be violent<br>wowza<br>people believe some nutty shit<br>can you imagine being stuck in<br>an elevator with prints that would<br>be crazy we love it for like he’s a genius<br>we love to<br>just be in that guy’s presence and just talk to him<br>a fascinating dude<br>but sometimes even dudes who are geniuses at anything<br>whether it’s<br>playing chess or you know being a martial artist<br>there’s sometimes there’s something<br>wrong with them to get them there<br>there’s something<br>about getting really amazing at something<br>people that are the very very best at something<br>who almost all crazy<br>it’s really hard not to be you know<br>could you imagine<br>if you were like<br>the best in the world like a lance armstrong type<br>dude how’s that dude not fucking crazy<br>and then he made pancakes out of your pancake story<br>what pancakes wasn’t<br>about waking up in the morning<br>making a devil’s pancakes<br>oh that story yeah I can’t tell you that<br>yeah that would be so rude<br>a personal story lace gentleman I protect my friends<br>who is joe rogan who are you man<br>how dare you todd jones<br>who am I yeah man who<br>maybe that wasn’t like thinking deep start<br>no I didn’t think it was joe<br>he ain’t thinking deep<br>it’s being mean to me<br>but if you ask if you ask I say you either man<br>but fuck you man<br>but if you ask that same question to john malkovich<br>you’d be like<br>who was john malkovich<br>I’ll tell you you know like you would really<br>look at that different product I gotta reboot this up<br>my shit is wax<br>dude how awesome is that<br>dana white’s playing all the pride shit on spidey dude<br>the prides are so much awesome man<br>I’ve been addicted to it there’s so much fun<br>I showed brian the<br>the difference between the rules<br>brian was on why I talked about in my blog<br>where when the dude tried to stomp the dude he went<br>he could do that<br>remember yeah I was really stone and no I pre warned me<br>the next thing I know<br>this guy’s like stopping this guy’s brain<br>and I’m like whoa whoa<br>you see trying to kill the guy<br>it was pretty fucked up<br>it was pretty fucked up<br>it’s like when you watch those<br>those pride fights like they were pretty fucked up<br>you know it’s like well let’s go ufc<br>you see like that<br>yeah but you know there’s something about<br>the way they did it man I like it<br>I love the fact that they did 10min rounds<br>the first round is 10min that’s great<br>that’s how it should be<br>yeah<br>well you know and everybody says no bullshit because<br>it’s too hard on the fighters<br>I don’t necessarily know if that’s true<br>you know there’s a lot of times where<br>a momentum is being established and<br>it’s been established and<br>you would like to see where it goes<br>you don’t want to see them like fuel up and<br>have some water in<br>the corner I want to see where it goes from there<br>from there if a dude works for like 4min<br>it finally gets the guy out of the ground<br>or if a guy gets take down immediately<br>and a dude<br>finally gets up and there’s only 20 seconds left<br>and then the dude starts bombing on him<br>and then the guy who took him down is tired<br>I want to see what the fuck is happening<br>keep going you know<br>I mean that’s what<br>I think that’s what the best guys would want<br>the best guys would want to see that<br>they would want to see<br>a big ass 10min around<br>in the interest of the safety of the fighters<br>though they’re gonna take less damage in a 5min round<br>that’s why I accept it<br>I accept the unified rules because if you look at it<br>like in terms of like what’s<br>what’s gonna be the most palatable for the american<br>for the american public<br>yeah that’s the most palatable 5min rounds you know<br>five rounds for championship fights<br>I totally agree with all that stuff<br>the only thing<br>sometimes I think<br>that I would substitute knees on the ground for elbows<br>I think knees from that position<br>when you’re holding on to a guy<br>and you can name in the face<br>elbows on the ground<br>cut that shit how to do<br>and sometimes they they fuck up fights<br>you know they they<br>they’ll end a fight early that was like<br>a really good fight and it’s because of a cot<br>I mean usually that doesn’t happen<br>but in case you know<br>the ufc is so much better about that than boxing though<br>boxing<br>any kind of a bad cut and they’ll stop the fight<br>like right away<br>ufc lets stefan strew fight<br>and he had like a hatchet wound in his head<br>I mean it was a giant cut<br>it was a giant cut and then let the fight go<br>and he eventually got the dude down and choked him out<br>and it was an incredible fight<br>I mean he was busted wide open covered with blood<br>it was insane<br>and after it was over<br>the guy was so dizzy he had lost so much blood<br>he could barely talk<br>to me and I was talking to him after the fight<br>it was incredible<br>now they would never let that happen in a boxing match<br>and I think it was<br>kind of crazy that that fight took place in Germany<br>because the germans were<br>kind of reluctant<br>to have the ufc there<br>and then I was like thinking like wow<br>this is one of the bloodiest fights ever<br>and you know<br>shh<br>this is where it’s gonna take place<br>yeah the place where they’re apprehensive about it<br>you know apparently a bunch of German dudes came<br>down to see the ufc<br>in vegas and you know they didn’t like it<br>they thought it was<br>horrific and violent<br>what’s kind of like pink spinning with the water<br>did you see that on the grammy dude<br>that girl’s so talented<br>that’s pretty amazing though she’s very talented yeah<br>she’s something about her<br>her performance charisma<br>like what she walks on stage is like<br>you have to like step back<br>yeah you know she’s got it whatever it is<br>she’s got it she’s hot<br>she’s she’s like<br>there’s something about just the way that she like<br>just walks on stage<br>and sings so confidently and so calmly like her energy<br>it’s like that’s a girl that’s born to perform<br>that bitch can perform her fucking ass off<br>and then when she goes up in the air you’re gonna go<br>oh well the other ones are gonna do the acrobatics<br>she ain’t gonna do shit<br>she’s just kind of kind of like it lifted up<br>no she gets all fucking crazy<br>and she’s like in this half naked outfit<br>and she dunked and wanted<br>and she’s spinning around<br>and then she turns up<br>she’s spinning with her head down<br>and she’s singing at the same time<br>that’s that’s the banish bitch in music period<br>everybody else shut the fuck up<br>shut the fuck up man<br>pink just owned all those bitches<br>all of them lady gaga sit the fuck down<br>would you not see what happened<br>can you do that if you can’t shut up<br>lady gaga is pretty good too I didn’t see it<br>that fucking poker face song made me want to<br>punch holes through walls<br>I likely no worry you don’t like it all you want fella<br>it’s not my cup of tea<br>boo my my my poker face<br>I love I love chick songs I love when chick sing<br>yeah people get in my car and I think it’s a joke<br>dude you gotta get this<br>CD leitigrat led<br>sales told me yeah I think maybe I told you already<br>yeah like tig<br>Twitter recently yeah<br>dave fucking jam man yeah<br>like punk chicks punk chicks yeah<br>oh dude I’m all over that that<br>teagraph I love chicks with like great voices<br>like people would get my car<br>and like I have cheryl crow on<br>and they would think it’s a joke<br>like what are you joking oh my god I like this long<br>it’s good CD<br>it is her voice is like her voice is like comforting<br>you know her voice makes you want to like<br>feel like you’re gonna cut it up in the corner<br>in front of the fire<br>sarah mclacken<br>she’s giving you a big hug with her voice you know<br>it’s French foot of time the breeders<br>the what the breeders remember them<br>the ones that sing<br>that had a big song in nineties<br>I mean last splash dananananananananana<br>they were like big and then they just went away<br>yeah I think it’s really hard<br>to keep a musical band together<br>you know I know eddie has a hard time<br>like keeping he does a<br>bunch of different projects all at the same time<br>so the desert ever has to rely on any one person<br>and he runs all of them<br>it’s got to be super hard to keep a bunch of people<br>who are like wanting to be stars and you know<br>wanting to<br>just can’t wait to get rich and get nutty and<br>fucking lose their marvels<br>and think that they’re the reason<br>why this band’s there<br>in the first place<br>and how many arguments like that happen in bands<br>you know yeah<br>they’re all nuts<br>they’re all they want to be the outfit so very<br>rare that a band like can really<br>you know like a food<br>fighter’s band or something like that could really<br>come together<br>and just be that’s just badass band<br>and keep it together and make good music<br>so hard<br>you know it seems like<br>bands bands are good for like<br>they’re good for like a couple of cds<br>and then it just gets rough<br>for most of them<br>the rare few can just keep jamming on you know<br>the rare few like the rolling stones<br>just keep it together forever<br>that’s nuts<br>you know<br>like they don’t go out like<br>the crazy thing about the rolling stones is<br>they’re going out like a young rock band<br>like they they fucking<br>you know mick jagger still bounces around on stage<br>and yelling and shit<br>like he’s an incredible shape<br>you know that’s that’s the amazing thing about how<br>the stones are doing it<br>it’s not like he’s just<br>you know<br>decided in his<br>you know later years<br>he’s just gonna stand there and sing this song<br>I still fucking running around<br>and he still takes his shirt off and shit and he<br>looks like a monster<br>you know he looks like a bunch of knees yeah<br>he just glued a bunch of knees like<br>put the fall on lotion in the basket guy<br>yeah that’s hilarious<br>but he’s got like a six pack of chit<br>yeah the dude has to be in insane shape to do that act<br>that’s incredible man<br>mcjagger still keeping it out there<br>yeah<br>so is what’s his name<br>springstein<br>and all those guys<br>greenstone yeah yeah he’s still out there<br>doing crazy 4h concerts and shit<br>you know what man those guys have people that love them<br>there’s people<br>there’s people that have fans<br>and then there’s people<br>like bruce bringsteen that have people<br>that worship him<br>and live for<br>the fact that bruce bringstein is alive<br>and their whole day<br>revolves around springstein<br>and they probably post on a message board somewhere<br>and their message board name is probably like b<br>springstein or something like that<br>you know I’m saying<br>or some obscure nickname that they know<br>that bruce bringsteen had when he was younger<br>that they dropped after a while<br>you know I’m saying<br>you know the fucking<br>the long island expressway<br>whatever the fuck it would be you know whatever<br>they would call them<br>people get nutty man<br>you know<br>people get nutty about people especially jersey guys<br>he’s from fucking jersey bruce brinks he’s from jersey<br>still lives in jersey and loves jersey<br>they get fucking crazy jersey people are so crazy<br>there’s savages<br>there’s savages<br>that’s why I was born by the way don’t get angry<br>I’m talking about me<br>I just saw a kitchen nightmares that was in jersey<br>and the whole family was just out<br>of their minds<br>there’s some of the toughest guys that fight<br>in the ufc here from jersey<br>really frankie edgar jim miller dan miller<br>those guys are all jersey guys they’re fucking savages<br>there are different kinds of dudes<br>they will fight you<br>they will fucking punch you in the head<br>it’s like it’s a totally different type of human being<br>than like the average dude that grows up<br>in California<br>people are so much more relaxing California<br>so much friendly or so much nicer<br>jersey people will punch you in your fucking head<br>it’s not all of them you know<br>and they’re not bad guys<br>they’re not you know they’re not mean<br>they’re just there’s a level of tension<br>in certain towns<br>philly’s another one<br>there’s a level of tension in philly<br>you know that<br>the dudes who come out of there are<br>you know so many badasses come out of Philadelphia<br>boxers joe frazer came out of Philadelphia<br>bernard hopkins came out of Philadelphia<br>and mma got eddie alvarez<br>comes out of Philadelphia<br>and Philadelphia is filled with fucking animals<br>you know that’s that’s a crazy ass tough town<br>it’s weird how there’s towns like that<br>isn’t it there’s certain talents that just have<br>like like you know no one thinks of like<br>San Francisco is being like aggressive<br>you know you know what I’m saying like<br>it’s like that’s kind of a relaxed town<br>you’d almost feel like if you got<br>mugged in San Francisco<br>you’re a pussy<br>but no there’s like regular people in San Francisco<br>there’s violence there too<br>but some places just way more violent right<br>Columbus you grew up in Columbus Ohio yeah was that<br>that was the tents in the winter<br>no not really but the worst is I like Cleveland<br>like cleveland’s getting bad in but Michigan<br>driving through Michigan to go to the casinos<br>that was scary like cars on fire and houses<br>they got bears walking through Detroit<br>they spotted bears in the city of Detroit<br>there’s so many abandoned houses that<br>bears are starting to move back around<br>that’s nuts yeah<br>bears in Detroit<br>wow that’s a spooky shit man that’s like one of my bits<br>it really is<br>that’s like the the bit I have about the the<br>the dumb people out bringing smart people<br>the smart people die off and everything shuts down<br>and then the dumb people are stuck there<br>but in this case<br>it’s poor unfortunate people that were actually born<br>in this one town<br>it’s happening so fast<br>you know Detroit is falling apart like this insane rate<br>and it’s not getting any better<br>it’s like it’s the<br>they say that it’s over 50% joblessness in Detroit<br>because they report like 20 something %<br>but the rest of them are just people who have stopped<br>they stop counting them after like a year<br>it’s crazy man<br>it’s scary you know<br>we used to make the coolest fucking cars ever<br>if you compare just on a coolest factor<br>like some of the cars that america was making<br>in like nineteen sixty nine and then like alpha mayo<br>those gay looking pieces of shit<br>those goofy looking clunk boxes<br>take a nineteen sixty seven corvette over<br>all those bitches<br>you know america was making some radical fucking cars<br>man<br>67 vet 69 camaro<br>those fights still making pretty good pretty good cars<br>starting to a jay k

recalls on her car<br>get the fuck I swear to god doing it with lexus<br>and the lexus was the one that was in that car accident<br>what yeah<br>I’m pretty sure<br>here let’s google that<br>alexis where you come 9 1 1 call<br>tell you the lexus it’s a matte recall it’s a matte<br>they’re not saying anything about a software thing<br>no<br>steve wazniak pull up the link where wazniak said that<br>about a software it’s on in gadget yesterday<br>let’s post it up for people<br>because this is kind of important<br>okay otherwise we could get in trouble all right<br>not really but<br>then we not for sale he said that if he didn’t no<br>we could say he fucking says he likes this like cock<br>you know how do you say that<br>see you just made something up about him<br>you can’t be saying that I didn’t make that up fine<br>I’m talking about steve waznik my dog<br>oh you two dog you guys tight<br>yeah I didn’t know boo my dog you seen that they added<br>multi touch to the<br>that new<br>google phone yeah<br>just like an iphone does the same thing<br>yeah it’s about time now<br>nobody owns the right to do that<br>nobody owns that<br>supposedly apple had the us patent on it<br>so so what are they selling that’s all these people<br>it’s probably<br>but I don’t know if that’s all speculation<br>actually it’s probably gizmodo that had it<br>you can’t find that your motherfucker<br>google this is gizmo<br>google it bitch<br>this is one<br>this is no way to run a fucking internet show is<br>gentlemen what we’re gonna find out which cars were<br>we’re recalled<br>and whether or not steve waznag actually<br>said it was a software issue<br>yep that’s scary it really pissed<br>that’s scary shit because that guy’s a super genius<br>one of the guys who helped create apple<br>you know and<br>you know that’s not something that harry yeah<br>would say lightly<br>okay<br>toyota to borrow steve wozniak’s priest for a week no<br>that’s not it<br>there yeah<br>no that’s software duplicate<br>that ain’t any of that<br>that’s it yep<br>toyota prius has scary<br>software program he can duplicate<br>told the crowd of von tischel cellation<br>problem in the prius<br>oh it’s not under a recall<br>this is software it’s not a bad accelerator pedal<br>it’s very scary<br>whoa<br>toyota has had<br>toyota has this accelerator problem<br>we’ve all heard about<br>I have many models<br>a prius that got recalled but I have a new model<br>didn’t get recalled<br>this model has an accelerator that goes wild<br>but only under certain conditions of cruise control<br>and I can repeat it over and over again safely<br>whoa holy shit<br>that’s fucking terrifying<br>so that’s what’s the greatest thing about old cars<br>old cars are fucking terrible to drive<br>like my old 1970 barracuda<br>yeah but<br>there’s something<br>about old cars where there’s no computer running<br>nothing there’s like a direct experience<br>between you and the engine you know<br>and I’m saying like those old the old<br>the sound of the engine<br>everything about it connected to the car<br>it was all connected<br>there ain’t no fucking computers gonna save you bitch<br>it’s just a car<br>you better not get crazy<br>the better I think you can you know<br>take that turn<br>too quick and<br>you know the wheels will lock up on the outside<br>so you’ll be alright<br>no you’re fuck man<br>that’s not gonna save you<br>one of the many reasons not to buy a prius<br>you know what’s really interesting<br>I think it was a prius that they did<br>they did this because a prius is a hybrid right<br>yes yeah that was a prius then they took a prius<br>this was a lot they did this on top gear that<br>fucking awesome car show on the bbc<br>if you haven’t seen it it’s like<br>you could get it on bbc<br>I’m like do you get it in direct tv<br>they have like bbc america<br>and it’s an awesome car show<br>and they did this test where they took a prius<br>and they ran it around a track as fast as it could go<br>as fast as they could get it to go around the track<br>and they followed it with a bmw<br>m three which has a big v eight<br>and they found out<br>that all<br>the if the bmw all the bmw had to do was to stay<br>at the same pace is the prius just keep up with it<br>that’s all it had to do<br>well when they measured the miles per gown the bmw<br>got more miles per gown than the prius<br>it’s like when you drive it fast<br>it’s like it’s a piece of shit<br>it’s like<br>yeah there’s no reason to there’s no reason to<br>on the long run<br>the price also<br>costs so much more<br>money that you’ll be spending on the car that<br>it’s not even worth the money you save on gas<br>they’re gross looking too and it was<br>I think they said it was like the difference from like<br>the prius was only getting like 14 miles to the gallon<br>and the bmw got like 17 or 18<br>yeah by the way I posted the<br>those deep quality on those numbers<br>steve woz in the act video<br>has posted at my Twitter which is backslash red band<br>well I’m gonna retweet retweet my shit<br>retweet fucker you know how we do<br>and what’s awesome weird talking about the ipad now<br>so a manufacturer<br>that’s going to fix ipads<br>he has a company that fixes iphones<br>fixes like a third party warranty guy<br>did you tweet that<br>yeah I<br>just got a just got just now<br>just because you’re using that<br>oh good<br>go to my Twitter page<br>do it how you’re supposed to do it<br>that’s gross and use a Twitter page<br>if you don’t use tweet deck man you live in so 2000<br>I don’t twit that much<br>oh yeah whatever<br>lies I forget what I sang yeah because you’re stoned<br>oh so this ipad manufacturer that is going to fix ipads<br>he fix his iphones<br>just got a shipment of replacement bezels for the ipad<br>so if you ever have to replace that<br>and it has a spot for a camera in it<br>damn and that<br>the software has<br>caused to a camera and all those other things<br>so the ipad they might not even be done with the ipad<br>like it’s gonna come out with a camera<br>and all these other things<br>probably damn that’s what it looks like<br>so this is just the beginning<br>so the first one is just this plain one<br>the first one was not finished is why a lot of people<br>are thinking like it was like a prototype<br>because that’s why it’s two months away and stuff<br>they were still<br>really<br>this is all this<br>sounds like some fucking conspiracy’s type of shot<br>some marketing shit too<br>probably think probably<br>why would you do that though<br>why would you release a crappy one<br>or you’re not a crappy one<br>people are gonna be talking about it every time<br>there’s like a new rumor you know like oh now it has a<br>well maybe they’ll hold off<br>a few months and then come on with<br>a version too<br>maybe they’ll do that<br>but if they’re<br>doing anything<br>like the iphone it’s probably once a year you know<br>they got it down man they got people their bitches<br>apple has more people their bitches<br>than any other company in the world<br>did you see the spy shot of the next iphone<br>which is funny<br>because I was just thinking how<br>I’m a little bit of an apple bitch<br>I’m gonna be honest with you<br>they got me a little<br>I get all all fucking hyped up and I finally<br>have a new announcement<br>I get fired up<br>I don’t remember<br>the last time I ever got fired up for anything<br>that microsoft max<br>it’s funny because these photos<br>I get released like this photo<br>the next iphone is so awful<br>it could be just like a box on the ground<br>and it’s like people are freaking out about it this<br>you know what’s really funny people<br>yeah what is that what the fuck that is<br>what would people<br>are hilarious about that looks like an iphone man<br>people were torted I know<br>who gives a shit whether these windows or mac<br>everybody gets nutty<br>that’s what’s really crazy about all the shit is that<br>people pick teams<br>you know with their own team windows or team mac like<br>what the fuck do you care like really<br>why does everybody want everybody else using the same<br>shit<br>if you don’t prefer it that’s fine I don’t give a fuck<br>I have taken pictures and had a picture online<br>you know of me<br>on a laptop and you see the little apple thing<br>oh joe

heart<br>brighter than usual<br>guys sound like jiminy crickey I know haley pinoke<br>I’m not gonna get in trouble<br>you’ve got to go to school okie<br>oh come here and look at this<br>is that trouble in this guy<br>what a horrible track there’s my handkerchief<br>there was like a feet<br>the woman not to belittle the challenger exploding<br>I remember<br>I was watching that I was at this girl’s house<br>I was like it was nineteen eighty six so I was<br>it wasn’t 86<br>yeah I wasn’t I was just like 19 years old<br>completely lost<br>it had no idea what I was doing in my life<br>I had a hard time getting laid<br>very difficult<br>so this ex girlfriend<br>who lived like an hour and a half away<br>and I was talking<br>around the phone and we were talking dirty<br>and she wanted me to drive up the visitor<br>and<br>I was such a fucking long drive and it was the winter<br>it was snowing out<br>and I’m an idiot and I went out there and<br>completely forgot what I was talking about<br>how high am I<br>we’re watching challenger<br>so we’re sitting there and<br>we’re sitting there<br>in front of television in the morning<br>and she goes to the bathroom<br>and I turn on a tv and right<br>when I turn on a tv it fucking exploded<br>it was that 2nd wow right<br>when I turned on the tv<br>they were showing it and I don’t know if<br>it was a replay<br>I don’t think it was<br>it’s hard to remember<br>but I remember like<br>very clearly at the moment I turned on tv the image<br>of the thing exploding was happening right there<br>and you were seeing in spiral and you were like<br>what the fuck is that<br>it was like a weird like what is that<br>what’s going on over there<br>and then people start talking about it<br>and then it took like a while before<br>they just flat out admitted okay<br>everybody’s dead like that shit just blew up<br>like I think for a while they were like<br>you know wondering whether or not the people<br>had survived if the capsule had made it to the ground<br>you know they’re looking for parachutes and shit<br>it was all sorts of different kind of reports<br>but I remember thinking holy shit<br>those people just got<br>shot through the fucking air and exploded in the sky<br>what a crazy way to go<br>what a crazy thing to do<br>you know it’s so weird when I saw it<br>I saw it with a bunch of people<br>and we all had to watch tv because we were<br>in middle school<br>and then happened and I went start crying<br>and I just remember<br>like oh what’s going on<br>and the teachers were all freaking because<br>you couldn’t like just text your mom<br>like hey mom do you know what happened<br>so you had to get like these birds and tied messages<br>too<br>yeah you grab the runner<br>a man who swift a foot knows the way home<br>here’s the letter<br>quickly run<br>so amazing how back in the day you just had no<br>communication with friends and family<br>you called people<br>and if you got a whole of them you got a whole of them<br>yeah and if you didn’t<br>I mean<br>it must have been so easy to get away with everything<br>back then tell everything<br>I was thinking about having a sex who you were<br>when I was<br>teenager I would have sex in public places because I<br>wasn’t allowed to have sex at home<br>so I’d go to behind little<br>caesar’s pizza and fuck behind beside the dumpster<br>and one time this guy came out was like shocked like he<br>worked at the pizza place it goes<br>oh I’m sorry<br>you want some pizza<br>cause he thought we were homeless or something<br>oh my god<br>but I’m thinking nowadays you on the ground<br>lying on yeah lang on or it was just like god<br>but but now ground on the dirt<br>did we used to do it a movie thing<br>they see doing new atheists all the time<br>like you just get her to like climb on top<br>and you go see fern gaully<br>you know because no one else is sitting during the day<br>watching fern gaully<br>but you’re in the back half of fern gaully having sex<br>but nowadays can you imagine<br>I can’t do that because it’ll be filmed on YouTube on<br>you porn is like everyone is filming and<br>I wonder if kids are having a hard time<br>finding places to have sex without<br>like cameras are being caught<br>yeah<br>it’s not it’s not like naturally<br>you know<br>what’s really fucked up is this whole sexting thing<br>with young kids<br>and what’s happening<br>if you don’t know is that these young kids are sending<br>you know you give a<br>13 year old a cell phone<br>they’re gonna take pictures of their dicks you know<br>right they gonna send to girls<br>girls are gonna take pictures of their pussy<br>they gonna send the boys<br>it’s like school musical girl<br>there’s always gonna be one freak bitch in the class<br>it’s willing to take it to the next<br>level alright<br>there’s always one girl whose dad just was not around<br>and she needs male attention<br>and she needs it extremely bad and she’s willing to<br>fucking loke out<br>we are so lucky because<br>my shit would have been everywhere<br>there would be live video<br>let me just have sex on webcams if this happened yeah<br>it gets pretty crazy<br>it could get pretty crazy<br>you know it’s just really wrong that kids when<br>you’re that young<br>you make all kinds of fucking mistakes people<br>they do all kinds of stupid shit you’re dumb<br>the fact that<br>kids today like what anything you say and do back then<br>is like that shit is like a record forever<br>you know<br>any any blog you write any myspace picks you post up<br>like that shit’s a record of you<br>for the rest of your life<br>you know and for some kids they fuck up and<br>picture of them sucking a dick<br>and then some dude who<br>ordinarily would like really love this chick<br>but it can’t get over the fact that this is<br>picture that every<br>one of his friends has<br>of her sucking her ex boyfriend’s cock and it’s online<br>I mean he just freaks out he can’t fucking deal with it<br>and that ruins the relationship<br>because this dude can’t deal with the fact<br>there’s a picture<br>online than anybody could say<br>or have his wife<br>you know the mother of his children supposedly someday<br>socket some other guy’s<br>dick especially if it’s a black guy<br>right<br>then we go back to the julia roberts something about it<br>hurtin hurtin<br>you know black eyes let’s be honest<br>you know<br>for the most part except for obviously brock lesner<br>he says that brock lesner is like<br>a white guy with black eyes genetics<br>check this shit out<br>this is a great email I got today for you blad<br>listen man we’re in a very tricky subject<br>he just interrupt me when we’re talking about genetics<br>black people until I clarify that I’m not a racist<br>how dare you okay<br>it’s very important<br>it’s going to go into another medical thing<br>it’s a funny thing that you would think that people<br>would think that<br>like saying that a black<br>eye having a bigger dick and a black eye being better<br>sexually and<br>more troublesome to white dudes<br>why how would that be racist<br>wouldn’t that be positive for black eyes<br>could you imagine what people were saying<br>that about you<br>alright that’s just why is it racist though<br>he’s digging so<br>but there’s a lot of people that if you say that<br>if you put it that way like<br>there’s people that would think that black<br>eyes being oversexual<br>or black eyes being<br>more well and down<br>hold on this is done let me shut this off<br>is that your pager making that noise<br>I don’t have the pager anymore son<br>and keep that shit up for lamp<br>what the fuck<br>what the fuck got sucker<br>put away the whip the poem’s dead<br>anyway ladies and gentlemen<br>what were we talking about plot guys dicks<br>if you’re not scared you’re not paying attention<br>go online there’s some incredible<br>fucking porn out there where you can’t believe<br>that’s really that guy’s dead<br>how many black guy porn<br>well there’s a lot of stuff if it’s fake though<br>like yeah<br>yeah there’s a lot of them that’s fake<br>and there’s a lot of them that are<br>real giant dicks<br>there’s a lot of them doing<br>there’s some dudes like<br>what’s that guy’s name<br>lexington steels dicks like 14 inches long<br>and it’s like like an arm<br>it’s huge it’s gigantic<br>that’s real there’s no white guys like that online<br>you know<br>because even like john holmes want to go old school<br>john holmes had a big dick<br>but he would let club you with it<br>he wasn’t stabbing you with it<br>it was so big it never totally got hard<br>it was like an elephant’s trunk<br>it never got hard it was disappointing<br>he had like these super hot checks<br>and they were trying to suck his dick<br>but he was all heroin<br>doubt with this<br>giant rubber monster dick just trying to<br>snake it into their mouths<br>you know it was never like<br>a black guy’s giant dick<br>right black guy’s giant dick is<br>that things gonna do something<br>some shit’s going down<br>have you been to the playboy mansion before yeah<br>I was there a couple times for the strike force fights<br>I went there for once I had to do<br>a fear factor broadcast it was early in the morning<br>for a marijuana project<br>were you going to told me that like<br>everything’s like so antique like the old yeah yeah<br>there’s something cool about it<br>I mean there’s something<br>ridiculous about that<br>they haven’t upgraded it and change it for the time<br>but there’s something kind of cool about a toe<br>because if you really stop and think about<br>I mean this is just a party house right right<br>like isn’t it kind of dope that this is the same<br>phone from 1970<br>I mean it’s a fucking<br>it’s like a rotary phone and shit now<br>you know<br>or if it’s a push button phone I can’t remember<br>it’s a rotary<br>a push button<br>but if it’s push<br>but it’s some old whack ass look and shit<br>you know but that’s kind of cool<br>because it makes you part of it<br>like yeah that’s you know they should upgrade it<br>that’s not even cool anymore<br>that’s shit to tired<br>but there’s so much history to it<br>that it’s almost like a living museum<br>to like Hollywood<br>you know I mean think about how many people<br>parted in that place<br>you know<br>that’s like where james khan was always hanging out<br>polyshore polyshore<br>and fucking have you seen the biodone thing first<br>is always hanging out there<br>have you seen<br>the biodome thing that’s been a banded by scientist<br>remember that<br>thing like the movie<br>the biodome was all about the indoor dome<br>those with polyshore yeah steven yeah<br>that’s a real dome though that’s a real biodone really<br>yeah and now it’s like a bandit<br>and like they showed it and had to do so<br>this is like where they were doing experiments<br>or seeing people<br>could live together<br>right and they banded it<br>what happened in those experiments<br>I don’t know<br>I thought that was a funny movie at the time<br>I thought biodone<br>was silly yeah it was funny<br>andrew dice clay’s old movie ford pharaoh<br>that was funny where he’s jumping off the building<br>he’s like my hair my hair<br>back when that came out I was a dice clay fan<br>not that I’m not anymore but I am<br>I am still I think he’s hilarious<br>I’ve got to see him<br>I’ve got to see dice the common store<br>so many nights go up and<br>who is just just crushing people in the audience<br>he’s a nut he’s a fun dude<br>you know I like his whole thing<br>I like his whole<br>his whole attitude is demeanor<br>I think he’s hilarious but when I was a kid he was<br>gigantic there was no comedian<br>the kids were more excited about when I was a kid<br>then dice clay<br>when dice clay blew up<br>and when he started doing like masses square garden<br>and shit that’s all<br>anybody talked about dude<br>there was kids all day in school<br>everybody built like you know what’s in the bowl<br>bitch you know people would say it everywhere<br>yeah I mean something<br>everybody was doing vice clay lines<br>you do a good dice clay<br>I’ve been around him so many years<br>you know at the comedy store<br>that was one of the craziest things about<br>being a kid and being a fan of his and then being<br>you know then starting to be an amateur comedian<br>and then you know doing<br>getting paid gigs<br>after a couple of years and then moving to California<br>new years and years later is that<br>I would go on and I would have to introduce dice<br>you know like the comic store<br>the way it used to work and still does<br>but the way<br>it works is each comic brings up the next comic<br>so like I got brought on stage by martin lawrence<br>I was one of the first time somebody<br>famous ever did it<br>and you know<br>he brought me on stage and I was like holy shit<br>like martin lawrence just<br>said my name and brought me<br>I was like to me<br>that was like a crazy deal<br>like you know<br>see that guy in tv and movies<br>and also I’m shaking his hand<br>and now I gotta go on stage after<br>him and nobody knows who the fuck I am<br>but dice clay was the coolest that was the craziest<br>one ever<br>that was like you know getting there who’s next<br>who joe rogan who the fuck is joe rogan<br>and I don’t remember how it said it<br>but when he brought me on stage it was like holy shit<br>dice fucking clay just brought me on stage<br>like that was<br>to me that was a fun moment<br>that was a crazy moment comedy you know<br>when I was a kid that guy was<br>the most hyped up comic ever<br>mark gaden yes<br>you did open up for me in<br>england<br>mark hayden is gonna freak out<br>he keeps insisting that this mark gaiden guy is not him<br>but whoever this mark gaiden guy is<br>I think he’s representing mark hayden very well<br>so I’m gonna keep pretending that he is him<br>who is joe rogan you doing stand up in c<br>o before the verses oh who is joe rogan hmm<br>is that like how these kids are talking these days<br>who is joe rogan<br>is that like a new way of talking to people<br>that doesn’t make any sense<br>that sounds cool that does kind of sound cool<br>you know if what is your name dude<br>car perversion car perversion<br>who is car perversion<br>you know<br>if that’s what you say when you see people and said<br>hey what’s up dude say<br>who is joe rogan<br>I do instead of a colorado<br>yeah I’ll be doing it somewhere<br>I don’t have anything booked but I will definitely be<br>there the night before<br>whatever the<br>I think the ufc fights are on a Sunday night I think<br>I’m not sure<br>but whatever night they’re on the night before<br>that whether it’s Saturday or Friday<br>I’ll be doing stand up<br>and I’ll put it on Twitter<br>and I’ll let you bitches know<br>have you heard of the cat that has predicted over<br>50 deaths in a nursing home<br>you know what that’s like<br>that’s like predicting alcoholics are gonna drink<br>that’s ridiculous that’s a terrible fucking prediction<br>no no no tell that fucking faggot cat<br>to go predict and I know what he’s doing<br>he curls up around people when they gotta die<br>yeah right when they’re about to die it’s luck<br>they’re dying<br>they drop it like flies here 1000 years olds<br>they’re a bunch of old people<br>living with other old people that are dying<br>well it’s not a fun environment<br>it just goes back to the whole weird thing about how<br>animals might have<br>senses that we don’t even know about them<br>they might they might call like one that video<br>the dog in the area it might be or it might be<br>these people are hanging on by a thread<br>so thin that we’re gonna cat hops in their lap<br>whoa fuck it I’m doom<br>and they just kick the bucket that night<br>yeah that’s possible too<br>man you gotta admit it’s impossible<br>can you discuss vaporizers I would recommend vaporizers<br>the volcano is a very<br>good one but it’s sometimes kind of a pain in the ass<br>I mean at the end of the day<br>you don’t want to be that guy that’s<br>sucking out of a plastic bag<br>it just seems like a junky move<br>I’m not a fan right<br>it seems like junky behavior<br>to be sucking out of a plastic bag<br>something seems wrong<br>but there’s another vaporizer that I enjoy<br>it’s like a glass pipe<br>like a glass lip<br>like sort of like a bong with a tube attached to it<br>and you stick it on this thing and<br>yeah that’s cool right that’s a cool one<br>you know why I like about that one you don’t need<br>you don’t need like five friends around<br>you need to get high<br>you know like when that bag fills up<br>you don’t know when to stop right<br>you know you keep sucking it in<br>and then you’re too high<br>and then you’re like I can’t even think<br>all right that’s not good<br>the other vaporizer you can take one hit<br>and bam and you know what’s up<br>I like that one better<br>but if you got a party you got a bunch of people<br>hanging around<br>and you’re all medical patrons panvidibongs<br>no<br>if you got a bunch of people around then<br>the volcanoes the shit<br>then it’s perfect<br>because<br>we’re all being junkies together<br>man let’s all suck out of this plastic bag<br>it’s weird well I’ll keep it together<br>yeah this is<br>something<br>weird about sucking out of a plastic bag to me<br>I’m just like you know I like a joint<br>just give me a joint that’s cool<br>I’m a fan of the joint too<br>you know what I like joints because<br>first of all because you don’t have to keep lighting it<br>and I hate the taste of lighter fluid<br>yeah you know that shit’s nasty<br>like if you have a glass pipe and you keep<br>tasting that lighter for you<br>yeah that should ain’t good for you<br>no it’s not<br>especially when it’s like someone has a zippo<br>yeah you’re like oh really<br>you got a zippo that should ain’t good for you<br>man I don’t like it<br>I like joints I’m converted joints man<br>I like that share with a match you know if I can<br>or if I’m doing it with a lighter<br>I get it real quick and I let it sit from it and then<br>I think there’s a residue man that gets<br>on the weed with those lighters<br>and I think that shit’s bad for you<br>it’s probably<br>worse for you than smoking for some people<br>like for your lungs<br>it’s got to be very unhealthy man<br>it’s like a toxic fume you’re inhaling<br>you know that ain’t good<br>you know we don’t<br>there’s no studies done on<br>you know<br>how many times you can fucking suck off lighter fluid<br>and<br>breathe it into your lungs and not do permanent damage<br>you know<br>joints bitches<br>matches and joints<br>stop fucking around matches and joints or<br>go with the vaporizer<br>if you don’t know what the vaporizer is<br>the beautiful thing is there’s no fire<br>there’s no smoke it’s like a mist and what it is is<br>you pack the the product the maribana<br>and put two into this little<br>filtered area<br>and then you connect that to this machine<br>and then it heats up and then<br>you inhale and it’s literally like mist<br>and that mist is just the pure thc<br>it’s a very heavy experience<br>it’s very<br>like you’ll come up with some of your craziest thoughts<br>on vaporized weed<br>except the only thing crazier is eating it<br>when you eat it<br>that’s the craziest<br>I don’t like that anymore<br>eating it gets scary<br>we’ve talked about that if I heard a nutmeg yeah man<br>your mama oh one<br>oh 8 9 3 yeah<br>yeah I heard you can get high off a nutmeg<br>somehow or another<br>one of the guys on our message board hr<br>I think he did it he tried it and documented it<br>he said it was really tripping<br>it lasted a long time and it grows<br>I think anything that’s really good<br>people would be doing it left and right<br>and I think this plenty should to get high on right<br>you know we don’t<br>but the one thing that I think is interesting<br>they came up with a new marijuana<br>it’s a synthetic marijuana and it gives you<br>like the same effects as regular marijuana<br>but you don’t test positive<br>really yeah and they’re trying to<br>they’re scrambling right now and make it illegal<br>and they call it k two<br>it’s called k two named after that mountain<br>and it’s a synthetic version of marijuana<br>so if you have if you’re a cop<br>if you have a government job and you have to<br>piss test all the time<br>you could smoke this shit<br>I used to in Ohio had to test test all the time<br>I need to go to the store and buy this shit<br>and like let me have serious man<br>why would we be keeping pots from smoking weed<br>if any bunny should be smoking weed<br>it’s cops if anybody what<br>cops should be smoking weed<br>cops should be smoking weed<br>fuck yeah but the people that calm down<br>yeah but these are like calm the fuck down<br>these are like intense people on weed<br>you know like to be a cop<br>you kind of have to be like a bully like I’m not always<br>I know a lot of guys<br>who became cops and a lot of them became cops because<br>it’s good money<br>and they’re tough guys<br>they do martial arts and they figure you know what<br>I can handle most situations I’m pretty friendly<br>I can handle this<br>this is good money it’s a good career<br>I could set myself up<br>have a nice pension<br>you gotta look at it realistically people<br>look at it it’s an economic choice for a lot of people<br>you know I have a lot of buddies that became cops<br>it’s an economic choice<br>they just<br>there’s a lot of people like it’s a great job man<br>if you can get it in a Boston police department<br>that’s good fucking money you make a nice living<br>you know you can get some<br>some detail work you know on the side<br>you know on weekends and shit like that<br>you pick up big money<br>you know guarding places and shit like that<br>and it’s a good job man<br>mm hmm it’s not all douchebag so<br>but there’s a lot of douchebags that work for<br>better cops that if they were stoned would be horrible<br>maybe not man<br>maybe they’d be more sensitive weeds not for everyone<br>that’s for sure<br>it’s not it’s not forever well they don’t have to do it<br>but I think you know<br>if they wanted to<br>if they wanted to mell out of the weekend<br>like surplicope<br>remember when surpacode got high back in the seventies<br>surfaco didn’t have<br>they didn’t have a drug test for superco<br>albichino when he was a cop<br>he’s a sinner smoking weed with his girl<br>hanging out just like that movie super fly<br>don’t you remember yeah<br>I’ve never seen super fly<br>you’ve never seen super fly laser gentlemen<br>if you ever seen it you only watch<br>one black sploitation movie from the seventies<br>it should be super<br>fly it’s one of the most<br>goddamn brilliant films to have ever been created and<br>when you’re high<br>it becomes a motherfucking masterpiece<br>because it’s real<br>I mean<br>this is a real move where they’re playing off real<br>cool cats and one time this guy says<br>you know I got everything about getting out of the game<br>I got off the thing I ever wanted<br>my hall my vines a white woman like you<br>my hall my vines<br>a white with my hall my car<br>my vines my clothes and a white women like you<br>wow it’s genius dude it’s hilarious<br>it’s such a bad movie it’s so fucking good<br>it’s so bad and so real like<br>you can take like a parody like airplane<br>and they’ll be funny<br>but they’ll never be as funny as something<br>that’s supposed to be good<br>but isn’t and it’s funny on accident<br>there’s something<br>about those that’s like a different kind of funny<br>you know they mean<br>like a holy shit funny<br>like what the fuck were they thinking funny<br>you know and superfly is one of the best of that<br>like sort of like show girls is<br>you know show girls you see<br>show girls and it’s like what the fuck are they doing<br>this is this movie’s crazy<br>you know and it’s one of them<br>what other movies are like that<br>well I just can’t believe<br>some of the movies from the eighties<br>I just can’t believe people actually bought like<br>you know like the howard the duck movie I’m like<br>are you serious<br>it’s a cartoon or<br>a comic book though it’s marvel yeah I know<br>but I can’t believe<br>yeah but he was cool in the seventies man<br>and the cool in the eighties too<br>when I was a kid I was a howard duck fan<br>I would buy howard the duck really books<br>yeah that’s weird<br>I was a marvel comics fan<br>and howard the duck was a big<br>part of marvel comics who had<br>drifted in and out of all sorts of comic books<br>they did a lot of like<br>cool shit with howard the duck<br>I saw that movie in the theater and it was great<br>because I was a kid and he was like I remember<br>he pulled out condoms<br>he’s like oh docky and I’m like yeah condoms<br>dude howard the duck was cool when I was a kid<br>because he was a duck but he was like adult<br>he was like a creepy duck<br>you know he was trying to get laid<br>I never read it<br>how was the duck as dope<br>I was a huge marvel<br>spider man nicely I love the x men<br>I love spider man<br>the hulk was a big the hulk fan<br>a big conan the barbarian fan<br>god damn I loved conan<br>you know I wish someone would have done<br>someone would do a real conan<br>like almost in the style gladiator<br>you know I’m saying like<br>a real high end<br>not a cheeseball one<br>I think they’re doing another one<br>but it seems I don’t know<br>it’s got the rock in it<br>I hate to be prejudiced<br>oh you mean the fairy guy<br>this is conan now<br>and there’s an image of him as conan<br>and I mean he certainly looks the part<br>and who knows maybe he could pull it off<br>but there’s a certain amount of movies<br>when you do a certain amount of kids movies<br>you know after a while I just gotta go<br>it’s hard for me to watch you and something<br>when you’re crazy<br>you know<br>he’s making crazy money and I just don’t want it<br>actually did good though<br>fake aggression<br>conan the barbarian<br>if you ever read the book that would be an awesome<br>I was a big fan of the books<br>this guy roberty howard<br>wrote him and he was this<br>mad genius who was super depressed<br>wrote all these books<br>and I think he was only like<br>36 when he blew his fucking brains out<br>just couldn’t take it anymore<br>I just lived a terrible life<br>lived at his mother<br>was super depressed apparently<br>and just wrote these incredible fantasy books about<br>you know<br>far off lands and a fucking conqueror who could<br>not be beaten with destroyed cut men down<br>fight monsters and shit and<br>oh fucking all these chicks and drank and wine<br>and it just he was just like a human<br>but yet hyper<br>human character<br>that represented all of this guy’s frustrations<br>fucking genius shit man<br>you know especially if you think<br>about the fact that guy was writing<br>into fifties you know<br>and then they by the time they made it a movie<br>you know harold swanson hay was like<br>damn dude why are you so modeled I feel big<br>that’s ridiculous you know<br>what’s the what’s the reason for that<br>yeah that’s not kona and kona is a<br>kona is more like a george Saint Pierre type build<br>did you like to<br>Georgia that’s kind of gay<br>more like<br>james irvin’s build that would be a good conan you know<br>like thick but looks like an athlete you know<br>like a hershel walker like hershel walker<br>yeah how about that motherfucker<br>47 years old dude has his first mma fight<br>beats a shit ass<br>I’m young boy<br>hershel walker’s 40 fucking seven dude<br>and he looks like a goliath<br>he still just swole as fucking chiseled and<br>those cotton dudes down<br>that guy’s a super athlete<br>they should be saving his dna<br>I don’t know how many kids that guys have<br>how many kids do you have<br>does he have kids have no idea if he doesn’t have kids<br>they need to get the guy to shoot some<br>loads into some cups<br>for sure right<br>don’t you think<br>get him you imagine if you got<br>herschel walker and one of the william sisters<br>and<br>they fell in love and I mean I don’t<br>know no disrespect to her so I believe he’s married<br>and I don’t know if the williams sisters are married<br>so let’s just hypothetically<br>make them in not in the real world<br>this is the fake world nobody get upset<br>but I’m saying<br>you get two<br>super<br>athletes like that and put their genetics together<br>it would be incredible<br>incredible<br>like you ever you know who lucia riker is<br>lucia riker is a female boxer<br>yeah this chick could punch like harder than men<br>she was incredible<br>she was so good<br>all the other female boxers avoided the fuck out of her<br>this is back in the tanya harding days<br>this chick was like<br>leaps and bounds above other female boxers<br>she was just a freak athlete<br>I don’t remember what nationality she was<br>I feel like I want to say<br>something latin american<br>all right she but she was from holland<br>but I don’t remember what her nationality<br>totally guessing<br>she was a dark skin chick<br>but god damn she was just his fucking freak athlete<br>just beat the fuck out of chick she even fought dudes<br>she got flat line though<br>she fought a dude and the dude connected on her john<br>just she went nighty night and it was weird to see man<br>yeah she was attacking<br>she was trying to cut this dude down<br>and the dude just bang<br>and she just flatlined stiffened up and face planted<br>yeah but it looked like before the flatline<br>like she was getting the best of the dude<br>the dude just hit too hard<br>there’s a thing about bone structure I think you know<br>like if you one of things<br>if you meet you meet a guy like that’s a big puncher<br>like I met michael moore once<br>michael moore was the<br>boxing heavyweight champion in the world<br>and<br>he was the light heavyweight champion at one time two<br>for a long time<br>he was a badass as the light heavyweight<br>I just couldn’t keep cutting the way he was too big<br>but he was like one of the best light heavyweights ever<br>but he’s got like a frame<br>like you meet that dude his like frame is heavy<br>you know his fists are heavy his shoulders heavy<br>that’s the type of dude when he hits you it’s just boom<br>there’s so much<br>there’s so much to him you know I’m saying<br>and a check even if a chick is really talented<br>ultimately they’re not built the same way<br>you know so just makes you think<br>like a chick like that like a lucia riker<br>you know matching her up with like an anderson silva<br>some other freak athlete you know whoo<br>god damn<br>I sound like some sort of a genetic engineer<br>I’m trying to mix future warriors<br>it’s gonna happen<br>it is gonna be like well you know what’s gonna happen<br>it’s gonna happen in a laboratory before<br>it’s gonna happen<br>with two people having sex it’s<br>not gonna happen<br>the old fashioned way<br>where the gladiator meets the warrior princess<br>it’s not gonna happen like that<br>the way it’s gonna happen now is you know<br>you’re gonna someone’s gonna take the attributes<br>you’re gonna get some<br>fat dumpy dude you know who’s got a little dick<br>but he’s got a lot of money because he’s crazy<br>and he’s invested all of his time<br>to learning the stock market and swindling people<br>and he’s gonna have children<br>that are like psychotic warrior<br>genius offspring<br>because he’s gonna like manipulate all<br>his shitty genes<br>and it’s gonna<br>create some super offspring<br>and why he’s a fucking his young wife and killing him<br>brock lesner is conan<br>yeah brock lesnar is conan<br>that would be a real conan<br>yeah that’s a real conan<br>that’s exactly what I’m talking about<br>like brock lesner is like<br>did somebody put that up there<br>yeah whoever put that up there we lost already<br>money Japan yeah<br>yeah money Japan that’s your correct sir<br>that’s the perfect bill<br>that’s what you’re talking about<br>just a big<br>giant motherfucker doesn’t look like a body builder<br>looks like a dude he’ll smash you<br>you know like the best fighters<br>I don’t want to say all of them<br>but most of them don’t look that ripped<br>you know I think when you accept george same pierre<br>he’s fucking chiseled<br>but like bj when it is in his best shape<br>he still has like a good layer of<br>fat on him and bj I think also has thick skin too<br>I mean this one of the reasons why bj doesn’t cut that<br>easy you know nobody<br>nobody’s got like a tougher face in bj<br>bjable fight like a five round fucking war<br>and come out of it like a couple of scratches<br>like it’s crazy<br>yeah you know<br>I mean it ain’t just that he’s<br>he’s fucking awesome which it is<br>I mean he is<br>but there’s something about that dude’s genetics<br>you know<br>everybody’s got different genetics man<br>that’s because<br>that’s one of the most amazing things about life<br>is the variation of human beings<br>I mean that we vary so much more than any other animal<br>if you look at like<br>the only animal that comes close is dogs<br>and dogs<br>supposedly are like that because we engineered them<br>you know which makes you<br>wonder what the fuck made so many people so different<br>because we vary so much<br>I mean the fact that<br>a Chinese midget<br>could have sex with tequilo neil and make another baby<br>and that baby would look like a combination of those<br>two and there’s that much variation<br>between like pigmies and women from Iceland you know<br>like mister vascustones ex wife<br>brigitte nelson<br>that big giant icelandic door dick looking chick<br>you know the that that her own flavor flave<br>they can have babies<br>you know they mean they’re so different<br>they’re so much diversity<br>there’s no other animal like<br>that except dogs you know rhinos<br>they look like rhinos you know what I’m saying<br>some fish look different<br>you know you get a small mouth bass<br>fucks a large mouth bass<br>they get crazy to get freaky with it<br>you know and you get a hybrid that’s possible<br>tigers and lions make lygers<br>but for the most part man<br>human beings are we’re the most diverse<br>we’re all weird fucking species<br>it’s kind of incredible too<br>when you think about the fact there’s so many of us<br>we think there’s so many humans you would think by now<br>we would all be a big<br>fucking blurry mess<br>it’s crazy when you see like countries like<br>asian countries where almost everyone<br>has a very similar appearance<br>you know almost everyone has dark hair<br>almost everyone is you know<br>within a certain height it’s changing now<br>like a Japan they’re making big giant dudes now<br>big giant athletic dudes<br>a lot of them are changing their diet too<br>I think it has something to do with that<br>look at you you motherfucker<br>what kind of show we run here man<br>the phone ringing how dare you<br>how dare you do do do do do<br>what is this guy saying do do do do fish I fuck talk<br>ladies and gentlemen what does that mean sir<br>I shouldn’t encourage that guy he’s fucking not<br>why are you encouraging him joe talk about nabiru<br>listen folks I’m gonna tell you right now nabiro<br>is not gonna save you okay<br>it’s not happening it’s not<br>it’s a myth not nabiro is a myth<br>I don’t know if nabiro is the truth but there’s<br>something<br>that we have in our head about someone coming down<br>and fixing everything<br>and<br>I don’t think that shit’s happening<br>I think we’re looking for daddy to come down<br>and throw down the<br>rescue boat and pull us out of this mess<br>and I think that’s why people look at<br>if you don’t know what nabiro it is<br>there’s people that believe that there’s a planet<br>that’s in an elliptical orbit<br>and every 3600 years it travels between<br>mars and jupiter<br>travels like very close to earth or<br>between us and mars rather<br>and this gigantic huge planet is responsible for<br>many many catastrophic events in earth’s history<br>and it’s also responsible for<br>these<br>beings called the anunaki to come from this planet and<br>go on earth and<br>create human beings with genetic engineering<br>I mean it’s some fascinating shit it’s all from<br>the sumerian text<br>and the sumerian text is the oldest known<br>written language<br>it’s like it’s called quniform<br>and they write it in these like little weird strokes<br>and<br>they one of the oldest civilizations that we know of<br>they had the first astronomy<br>the first astrology including they had detailed<br>depictions of the solar system<br>with like planets in all the right orbits<br>they had like mars and they had pluto<br>they even had pluto we<br>didn’t know about pluto until 1970<br>and they had a drawing of pluto<br>that was carved in the stone or that was<br>rolled onto a tablet<br>6000 years ago 5000 years ago<br>I mean it’s really really crazy stuff<br>and when<br>this guy zachariah sitchen<br>and this is where it gets controversial<br>cause some guys who are<br>scholars who are<br>language scientists and guys who are<br>archaeologists breaking down<br>ancient languages and trying to<br>figure out the roots of the word<br>they don’t necessarily believe<br>that sitchen’s right and they think that maybe he’s<br>you know<br>leaped lept to some conclusions and his depictions<br>I don’t know I have<br>no knowledge when it comes to foreign languages<br>so I don’t understand the argument<br>so I see it back and forth and I<br>it’s fascinating to me<br>it’s interesting you can’t prove it<br>who the fuck knows<br>but what is interesting is that culture<br>the samarian culture is crazy<br>they had the first everything<br>the first mathematics<br>they had the first use of the wheel<br>what the fuck bro shut your shit off man<br>jesus how dare you anyway<br>who the fuck knows<br>what’s more fascinating than this idea of a planet<br>because there’s not enough evidence<br>there’s another planet<br>but there is enough evidence that these people<br>back then 6000 years ago<br>had some amazing<br>view of the world<br>they had some amazing technology<br>they knew about the dna<br>the double helix of the dna that was<br>their sign for<br>medicine their sign for pharmacy<br>they drew a caducius which they still used today<br>as a sign of medicine<br>that’s crazy shit man<br>they had all these depictions of<br>there was like large people<br>with small<br>people in their laps and the small people had tails<br>and you know the people that look at these go look<br>this is genetic engineering the giants<br>they made the monkey to<br>the dna of the alien they created this hybrid look<br>maybe maybe<br>they just drawn a fucking<br>big guy with a monkey in his<br>lap and make the monkey like curious<br>george and look like a person<br>you know what the fuck man how<br>how can you tell me that<br>that’s exactly what that hits him and it could be<br>their cartoon<br>this is their little character<br>this is the crazy monkey that looks like a human<br>once I asked stupid questions<br>sit in my lap<br>that could be it right<br>I forgot what you’re talking to beeru bitch<br>you don’t even pay attention to me anymore you<br>got so deep in the stuff that like halfway through<br>I’m like all right<br>just my brain is<br>can’t even catch up anymore<br>to be honest with you<br>half the time<br>I don’t know what I started talking about<br>by the time we get to the end<br>what I found is that mcconduet ladies and gentlemen<br>these thoughts come to me and I just have to let it go<br>that’s the sort of sounds<br>faggy who sounds completely faggy<br>but that really is the truth<br>you know like<br>the better I get at comedy<br>the more I feel like<br>I’m not really responsible for what I’m doing<br>it’s like I gotta just do the work<br>I gotta write and I gotta perform enough<br>but when I get it<br>when I nail it and whatever it is<br>that when I tune back into the frequency<br>whatever it is<br>I just ride it<br>it’s like<br>it’s almost like the easiest thing in the world<br>it’s difficult to maintain<br>it’s you got to maintain your enthusiasm and<br>maintain your writing and maintain your performing<br>but when you’re in that groove<br>when you lock in and it’s the fucking show it’s fun<br>bam when that’s going on that’s just a ride<br>you just ride and a ride you’re not<br>you’re not doing anything<br>I don’t feel like it’s like if I dig a hole<br>in the dirt in the backyard<br>I feel like I just did something<br>you know I started that fucking hole it sucked every<br>dig but I got to the end<br>I give this feeling a satisfaction<br>when I go offstage<br>I never have like a feeling of satisfaction<br>I always have a feeling it whoo<br>that was crazy<br>yeah like yeah it’s like like a road something<br>like I just got off a crazy ride<br>you know<br>you don’t you know<br>I’d be like wow that was fun<br>that was cool set that was great audience<br>but I never feel like I just did anything<br>I always feel like I just wrote a crazy ride<br>you know that’s what it feels like<br>you know that’s like you have to<br>do it enough so that you’re comfortable enough<br>so that when you get up<br>it’s all smooth you know<br>you’re all it’s all fun<br>you know what you’re talking about<br>you know what you want to say you know<br>and<br>you’re working on what you want to say all the time<br>so that it’s always fresh<br>so it’s always relevant in your mind<br>so that enthusiasm is there<br>and if the enthusiasm is there<br>and then the audience is enthusiastic<br>and then you lock<br>those things together<br>and then you just ride it<br>once you get the laugh start going<br>you just start ride it and so much fun<br>it’s like you’re skiing downhill<br>I think you’re gonna get a seguette<br>on your left yeah<br>I don’t want to go with it<br>did you live in mountains<br>you could be<br>like all up in the mountain chasing coyotes<br>I want to be able to jump off right and quick<br>you gotta get a segue<br>I had a crazy jaguar dream last night man really<br>I had a dream that jaguars<br>big ones were trying to break into my house<br>I’m having<br>a very strange apocalyptic dreams lately really<br>not serious ones because I survived the apocalypse<br>like the real apocalyptic dream is everything<br>I’ve been having dreams pretty much at all lately<br>once I remember<br>for some reason<br>yeah I get every now and then I get these<br>the system fails<br>dreams you know right<br>every now and then like some mad max type shit<br>and maybe it’s just because<br>all these assholes are screaming<br>the sky is falling<br>you know<br>one of the things that was really interesting I was<br>listening to some<br>recordings of hunter s<br>thompson speaking at the university of colorado<br>and like it was like nineteen seventy four<br>and he was talking about you know<br>like the cfr which is like supposedly<br>the group of people that control the world<br>you know the global bankers<br>the buildup or group that type of shit<br>and he was talking about<br>you know like<br>what’s going on overseas<br>and what the United States is up to and<br>how corrupt the political system<br>is and how it’s probably<br>you know if it goes this way much longer<br>the country’s going to fall apart<br>but then you look at like<br>30 years later<br>it’s like still the same shit<br>yeah it’s still the same shit right<br>it’s like is it getting any worse<br>well there’s more people<br>so it seems to accelerate a little bit<br>because there’s more activity<br>there’s more humans<br>but it all seems to be going along the same lines<br>you know this the sky is falling crazy shit like really<br>I mean what takes something big marin<br>if it takes something<br>big you’re probably gonna be dead anyway<br>this guy’s really gonna be falling<br>it takes like a meteor<br>we need like a volcano like a yellowstone<br>which by the way ready for this<br>this is January 17th<br>there’s been over 1600 earthquakes in yellowstone<br>wow what’s coming fuck it’s common<br>if you don’t know yellowstone is a giant volcano see<br>nobody ever taught me this in school<br>do they ever teach you this in school<br>do you remember this<br>yeah do you yeah the caldera<br>the whole volcano thing that it’s gonna blow yeah yeah<br>I think it’s weird when you live there too<br>it’s like a lot of people can’t live there because<br>they’re in constant fear of it too<br>how could you not I forget who it was I think it was<br>adam corollar somebody or<br>was talking about when I was in high school<br>I don’t well I’m older than you how would you<br>30<br>don’t tell these people though they’re cruel<br>so I’m 7 years old in you<br>so you have to think about it like if we were<br>in high school<br>like I was in high school earlier than you<br>they probably didn’t even know yet<br>because<br>one of the things they found out about with these<br>yellowstone is they had satellite images<br>and when they took satellite images<br>that’s when they realized that<br>what they were dealing with was<br>a caldera which was a volcano that was so explosive<br>that the top literally disappeared<br>like be like<br>Hawaii but Hawaii fucking explodes and it’s just flat<br>I mean that’s how big this volcano is<br>it’s 300 miles across<br>that’s insane<br>and when it blows up you imagine 300 miles of explosion<br>straight up into the air<br>lava everything would be okay here<br>no we’d be fucked the whole continent would be fucked<br>we’d be fucked if we would have like a good like<br>1h slow lava or it’s no it wouldn’t be lava<br>you would be fucked because the ash would rain<br>and fuck everything up<br>it would kill animals<br>it would pollute the water supply<br>so what would fuck everything<br>I don’t know you think about it how much<br>it’s like heavy heavy like soot is like snow<br>okay except it’s much heavier so roofs would collapse<br>wow so you would get like you know<br>two three feet of soot that would come down<br>and even if you stayed inside your house and relaxed<br>your house<br>would very likely get crushed from this fucking soot<br>because<br>this soot would be thousands and thousands of pounds<br>on your roof<br>so it’s going to cave your fucking house in<br>you can’t breathe outside<br>the sky is filled with soot<br>you don’t understand everywhere<br>and it’s heavy thick shit<br>volcanic ash soot<br>you’re fucked<br>you’re fucked and it covers the continent<br>it comes over us like I said yeah<br>how long does it do you have any idea<br>well they know that there’s been<br>smaller ones where it’s just<br>killed a lot of things<br>and then there’s been these gigantic<br>earth shattering ones<br>every six to 800,000 years<br>and the last time there was one was 600,000 years ago<br>what if it was something like<br>it wouldn’t hit you for like a week<br>and so you just<br>slowly get out and people stay away they’re going<br>fuck what you do you would have to leave the continent<br>yeah well<br>I think you could be okay<br>if you could get off in north america<br>you could go to europe<br>if you knew that shit was going down<br>and you could get on a plane<br>and fly to england<br>just take your family and that’d be a crazy movie<br>evacuating the whole United States<br>well you know there’s a rock shelf in africa<br>that if it breaks off<br>they have these<br>underwater<br>these underwater landslides occur<br>where these big shelves<br>these mountains fall off and it’s happened<br>thousands of times throughout history<br>well if this one particular rock<br>flat this this whole area which they<br>predict one day will break off and go into the<br>ocean it’s one particular side of a mountain<br>if it does that<br>it’s gonna create a<br>gigantic tsunami<br>that engulfs the whole east coast of the United States<br>like miles in<br>it’s just gonna just<br>miles in water<br>I mean it’s just a gigantic chunk of rock<br>pouring into the ocean and these<br>fucking waves that are like a mile high<br>just gonna roll in and<br>wreck everything<br>it’s gonna be insane<br>or it’s just gonna be mildly irritating<br>you know it’s gonna be insane<br>it’s gonna be insane and it’s probably gonna happen<br>yeah you know<br>I mean it might not happen in our lifetime<br>yeah that’s exactly<br>but you can’t say either<br>so against it though not though<br>no no no there’s so many things<br>but there’s so many things do<br>there’s so many different things<br>the odds aren’t against it<br>you look at all of them together<br>the odds aren’t against it because<br>if you look at like meteors man they don’t know<br>when the fuck those are coming<br>they have no idea how many asteroids are out there<br>how many big chunks of fucking rock<br>and metal and iron are flying through space<br>and any one of those kajakas<br>and they’ve happened so many times over history<br>it’s been proven<br>there’s so many<br>planets that are scattered with craters<br>there’s no way we can predict it<br>there’s no I mean they could<br>martyr the sky and hope they catch most of them<br>but there’s always<br>ones that are sneaking right bias that we miss<br>it’s happening left and right man wow<br>what the fuck<br>that’s the government man<br>can you guys still hear us<br>that’s still recording<br>hmm well refresh your browser<br>refresh that<br>I don’t even know what the fuck we’re talking about<br>this is interrupting my flow<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>on a long time scale everything is inevitable<br>yeah that’s that’s that’s really<br>that dude just nailed it on the head<br>that guy money Japan again money Japan for the win<br>damn motherfuckers with money Japan<br>two good quotes he if he listens Japan he’s money<br>yo money money money<br>and if you talk to eddie about being in Japan<br>and how cool it was<br>no he just got back last night I haven’t seen him yet<br>I’d love to get a Japan yeah<br>he’s been in Japan though<br>when he used to work for pride<br>where did my Japan say<br>yeah long time scale everything is inevitable<br>that’s what people have to realize like<br>we know for sure that human beings have<br>a lifespan all right<br>you’re gonna die as much as you plan for the future<br>it’s what you’re gonna die<br>we know the planets have a lifespan as much as you plan<br>for the future<br>fucking sons eventually run into energy<br>it might take billions of years but<br>it’s gonna happen<br>and what we have to worry about is not just that<br>not just<br>earthquakes not just super volcanoes not just meteors<br>we have to worry about gamma ray<br>explosions we have to worry about<br>like supernovas<br>that happen out in space<br>that make these<br>giant gamma ray bursts and fucking flood the earth<br>crushing all our communication systems<br>crushing all our satellites<br>breaking everything<br>no wireless internet<br>no oprah everything shuts the fuck down<br>I mean that shit’s all possible<br>giant crazy solar flares there’s a<br>lot of shit that could fuck human beings up<br>you know there’s a lot of shit<br>you know and they say that<br>the polar ice caps have shifted more than once<br>in the past and they also say that<br>10,000 years ago during the last ice age<br>the north american continent like<br>half of it was under a mile of ice<br>I mean north america was fucked up<br>dude it was all ice you know<br>I mean that’s crazy shit<br>that’s only 10,000 years ago man<br>crazy things can happen<br>how would we stop<br>north america from turning all ice again<br>if the earth got that cold again<br>what the fuck would we do<br>what would we do turn on the heat<br>what the fuck would we do<br>what would we do<br>if all of a sudden north america started turning<br>into a fucking<br>mile high sheet wall of ice but odds are<br>dinosaurs would come back first<br>why why do you say that I don’t know what<br>listen bryan you can’t see that because<br>what makes these climate changes is very mysterious<br>most likely have nothing to worry about<br>maybe yes most likely<br>but there’s been some gigantic things<br>that’s the problem<br>I’m sure man at times I could<br>I could freak out about that shit<br>or I could just be like hey let’s<br>talk about real things that are freaking me out<br>that shit<br>I gotta pay my bill tomorrow you and do this tomorrow<br>I think people<br>avoid it though<br>I think people<br>it’s not just the fact that people<br>choose not to think about it<br>I think they typically avoided<br>so they don’t ever have to think about<br>like the real<br>the real big picture<br>the real big picture is very<br>frightening to a lot of people<br>you know there’s the big picture<br>like what are you gonna do with your life<br>and you know you’re gonna get married<br>you’re gonna have kids you know<br>you’re gonna get a good job<br>you’re gonna<br>now be able to put your kids through college<br>that’s the real picture and then the big picture<br>and the big picture is what the fuck are we doing<br>you know we’re involved in two wars it’s 2010<br>this is the age of information<br>we see everywhere that we’re being fucked<br>left and right<br>you know that<br>your bailout money is going to these corporations<br>the corporation ceos are taking<br>hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts for<br>bonuses and all this insanity and you’re like<br>what fucking bonus like that<br>they use the United States taxpayers<br>money to bail out the company<br>and now they get to get money they get bonuses<br>big giant checks for what for fucking up<br>like what kind of a criminal organization is this<br>and we’re accepting it<br>what the fuck is this country running under<br>that’s part a of the big picture<br>and then part b of the picture is<br>what the fuck we’re in space<br>that’s that’s the crazy one<br>the part b is<br>we are on a planet and this planet is one of<br>an infinite amount of planets<br>and an infinite amount of solar systems<br>and an infinite amount of galaxies<br>spread throughout an infinite amount of space<br>and that space and the universe itself<br>maybe some sort of a geometric pattern<br>that you<br>always get on the space thing<br>well that’s the most amazing thing<br>I do always get on a space thing<br>but it’s because I get on the space thing in life<br>when I think about life when I think about anything<br>when I think about<br>you know obama talking about gazing in the military<br>we must repeal<br>don’t ask don’t tell<br>finally gay people go to die too like this is nuts like<br>who the fuck wants to be in the military now<br>like at this point in time they’re saying to them<br>you know like oh look okay<br>we need gay people<br>let’s just be cool about this and you get gay people<br>we’re running out of people<br>who want to join the military<br>let’s get some gay people in it too right<br>you know the military I think in our grandparents era<br>you know I think they were you know they were at least<br>less under the illusion<br>that they were getting fucked you know this<br>I’ve talked to so many dudes that come back<br>and are so disillusioned<br>you know that pat tillman guy that’s the<br>best example ever<br>there’s a dude who’s a nfl football star<br>who decides that he wants to go fight for his country<br>the noblest of virtues<br>you know for a man<br>to want to represent his country in a time of need<br>to realize that he has to step up that<br>there are certain times in history where<br>men have to do things<br>and fuck all the glory from being an nfl player<br>he’s gonna do the right<br>thing and fight for his fucking country<br>and he goes over<br>there and gets killed and friendly fire<br>accidentally gets killed pretty quick too well<br>the crazy thing was how quickly he was<br>talking about how<br>fucked up it is over there<br>and how disillusion he is<br>and how it’s a mess<br>and his brother’s talking about it and they are<br>completely incompetent<br>and he was talking about how just a<br>completely unorganized it is over there<br>and chaonic and how he didn’t believe<br>you know in what he<br>what he joined up for the army in the first place<br>he was being tracked and that’s not what it was<br>and it was a fascinating fascinating fucking story<br>you know and that represents everything<br>that’s best about america<br>like a guy who is willing to look at it and say man<br>I need to fucking do something<br>fuck all this football playing<br>I’m gonna go over there I’m gonna make a difference<br>and then when he gets there he’s man enough to<br>go oh shit this is a mess<br>like this is not what I wanted<br>I’m not gonna<br>I’m not gonna be United States this bitch over this<br>this is craziness<br>this is chaos<br>and then he’s dead<br>you know I mean which is what happens<br>man you know you go to fucking warrant people die<br>it’s terrible<br>but it’s just at this point in time man<br>you know there’s got to be better ways around this<br>there’s got to be better ways to<br>and I don’t know what the fuck they are<br>what are you doing<br>let that shit back so we could see each other<br>okay I wanna read the fucking trap man<br>don’t be going on tmt<br>but I’m looking at yours so I don’t do like this<br>so we don’t look at two totally different things<br>like a couple of weird geeks<br>what about the ether<br>who’s doing the ether<br>that was a good nasa<br>I’m getting in a nas again lately<br>naus yeah you don’t like you need to move on man<br>you should listen to a kid cuddy<br>you could need to move on<br>I like there’s some good there’s some good music<br>I hate knives<br>I’ve overheard all too much of his stuff now<br>oh don’t be a bitch blind<br>she don’t get sick of the same music over I

do this kid cuddy<br>he’s just a smooth little wrapper<br>okay this is the song<br>whenever I travel this is the move<br>you eat a pot cookie<br>like right before you get to the airport<br>so then you board<br>you’re not riding dirty<br>you know to worry about anybody arresting you<br>it doesn’t even kick in<br>till like an hour into the flight<br>you know an hour into the flight<br>then your barbecued and then that’s the best way to fly<br>I mean it’s not like<br>you’re gonna operate in the heavy machinery<br>or you’re gonna think about yourself<br>you’re gonna think about life<br>you can think about a lot of deep important shit<br>when you’re high on an airplane<br>that’s the only way I travel<br>this is the best way to do it<br>but then when I land every time I land<br>I land to this song<br>think about yourself you gotta think about life<br>you guys think about a lot of deep<br>oh that’s what<br>that’s me with the delay I don’t want to listen that<br>this hip hop is dead song by nas<br>as soon as I land<br>this is the best way to travel your barbecued<br>okay you’re contemplating your role in the universe<br>you know these different<br>characters walking through the airport<br>that’s a big<br>Dr Dre<br>beats headphones on<br>and I get out of the plane like this<br>makes it like a ride<br>you tell me you don’t like this<br>yeah but I’ve heard it 1 million times<br>you playing your shit same shit overnight<br>who gives this shit I like new music<br>yeah but there’s some classics bitch<br>this is a goddamn classic<br>look at this thing it’s like nirvana<br>what is the biggest one<br>tell me what the fuck is wrong with you<br>stream what you stream<br>get it together<br>people what<br>I know you’re free<br>this this is whack can I read this social stream<br>yes ryan l egg<br>10 I can but<br>here’s the deal son<br>we got to keep this bitch flowing<br>and sometimes we’re gonna look at what you have to say<br>and sometimes we’re not<br>and all right there’s no rhyme or reason<br>don’t get crazy<br>don’t spam let the universe be your guide son<br>that the universe beer guide<br>just went down a notch<br>and my book jamming to that<br>the other side I liked to listen to at all<br>fairness is jimi hendrix voodoo child<br>that’s another badass landing song<br>I used to have that one as my main one<br>I would land and listen to what and the other one is<br>it’s a little gay<br>tori amos crucify<br>I like that song<br>what is wrong<br>I like that song I like landed to tori amos<br>why do we<br>crucify ourselves<br>are playing the piano<br>oh sexy and white<br>sheets like sheets she’s white<br>I get to see you in<br>your car with your fanny pack on<br>blasting out the tori aim is most of the time<br>I don’t drive with my fanny pack on<br>the only time I do is<br>when I’m on the way to the airport<br>people like give the fanny pack a hard time<br>matt sarah I saw you on<br>your video blog which is fucking hilarious<br>leading up to this week’s ufc<br>and I’m very much<br>looking forward to your fight with frank trigg<br>but I saw you coming down on the fanny pack<br>my brother and you got to let it go<br>not wrong with fanny pack okay<br>the only reason<br>there is something wrong with a fanny pack<br>is because<br>you know you can’t get laid if you wear a fanny pack<br>so who gives a fuck<br>anybody that won’t fuck you<br>because you wear a fanny pack<br>you don’t want them<br>that’s what I have to say that’s a functional<br>piece of wardrobe<br>it’s excellent<br>you fucking strap that bitch on right there<br>and you got all your shit right here<br>it’s nice<br>it’s right there you go to the airport you take it off<br>bam you walk through the metal detector<br>I’m not saying you have to wear it every day<br>but if I wear it fuck you man<br>fuck you I got a fanny back on<br>I’ve worn that shit on stage before<br>people get all angry I think it’s a prop<br>I’m like you sent a prop this is my fanny pack bitch<br>it seems like it would be a prop<br>yeah because it’s very unstylish but guess what I’m<br>the reality as I’m a 42 year old mary dude<br>with a family<br>so you’re trying to cover you trying to cover your dick<br>I’m not trying to fuck you<br>I’m trying to walk into the airport<br>I’m trying to cover your pod place<br>you’re trying to cover your hog<br>okay<br>we’re gonna have to pull that<br>fanny packs hide a boner really well not my boner bitch<br>maybe you’re boner<br>oh maybe I guess maybe maybe it would hurt<br>if you had like a cell phone digging into your dick<br>you know<br>I like more of like a little backpack sling box<br>it’s very rare that I walk with boners anymore though<br>that’s when I was a younger man<br>I said boners like you know<br>walk through the airport for some reason<br>just got this random boner cooking<br>I don’t get those random boners anymore<br>I get morning boners<br>but I’ll get no random daytime boners<br>especially if I do a lot of jujitsu<br>and that’s makes gigitsu sound very<br>gay because it kills your boner<br>I guess I never was<br>yeah<br>if you do a lot of gigitsu you’re tired all the time<br>you testosterones down<br>you know you’re worn out<br>and if you’re getting late all the time<br>do those two things<br>keep your bonus from just occurring randomly<br>but if you’re not getting laid and<br>you’re not even working out you’re not doing anything<br>your bonus will just start firing up<br>so let’s fuck come on<br>what’s up so fuck some bro who fuck bro<br>so bro get some turkey sliders<br>yeah if you’re not paying attention<br>if you’re not giving your dick the proper maintenance<br>work and you know<br>I had a joke that was in one of my cds from way back<br>I don’t remember which one<br>I think it was shiny but happy g hod<br>it was<br>you got a jerk off first<br>and then think about what you’re doing<br>you should always do that<br>it’s really important<br>because your biology will trick you<br>your biology will have you convinced that you should<br>go follow some<br>crazy grow home<br>lives in a bad neighborhood and leave your car on the<br>on the corner and her cousin’s gonna watch it like why<br>because you’re horny<br>you’ll do some dumb shit you’ll do some silly shit<br>you know and if you jerk off<br>you’re much less likely to do any of that<br>keep ever play racketball<br>no that’s the funny thing<br>you say that because I was just at a gym the other day<br>that had all these racquetball courts<br>and I was like that was like the first<br>times I’ve ever seen racquetball<br>oh really in a long time oh<br>you would seem like a be a scary racketball partner<br>you’d be one of those guys<br>no you know what man I don’t<br>this is why I don’t like my rack ball<br>I’ve had two knee surgeries oh yeah yeah<br>I’ve had both of my acls reconstructed<br>and I had another<br>miniscus surgery on my left knee and they work great<br>now I’m like I have no problem doing gigi too and<br>it’s their fun and it’s fine<br>but I think if I did stuff like that<br>like cutting back and forth all the time yeah<br>you run the risk of injuring yourself<br>you know jujitsu<br>I can kind of control the movements a little bit more<br>especially if you pull guard and you<br>control where your legs are going<br>you know when you’re<br>going back and forth like that<br>you’re putting tremendous amount of pressure<br>on your joints<br>you know any explosive movement like that<br>it’s really it’s like you know<br>it’s an interesting thing to watch athletically<br>but like for your body<br>eventually that shit’s gonna wear the fuck out of you<br>yeah you know<br>you know what’s the craziest thing<br>man you see like old football players man<br>you gotta respect the fucking dedication<br>that goes into that sport<br>the amount of pain those guys have to deal with<br>those guys get fucking clipped<br>you know I mean<br>some fucking football games that you see<br>like we see the clips on YouTube where dudes are<br>running full steam and just ugh<br>right into another dude and send him<br>smashing to the ground<br>and another guy fucking piles into it at<br>the same time you watching you just go jesus christ<br>your body your fucking body’s just gonna get mangled<br>and some of these guys like running backs<br>they’re like not that big dudes<br>you know these big fucking gorillas<br>you’re trying to get at them<br>woooo<br>football’s a crazy ass game man<br>you know when football will be the shit<br>when they can fix any injury<br>anything that haves anything that happens<br>they just zap you and it’s like they have<br>apple backup for your hard drive<br>that’s all they have for your life<br>right before you go into do anything dangerous<br>they back up your life<br>you know like a couple weeks ago<br>and then they reload you back into the grid<br>like oh I’m back<br>did you die yeah I died dude I fucked up<br>you know I got crazy<br>you know how crazy would that be<br>yeah I mean look if you believe in like ray kurtz wheel<br>and these futurists that believe that one day<br>you were going to be able to download consciousness<br>into a computer<br>I mean at a certain point in time it becomes<br>the real question becomes like what is reality then<br>if you’re downloaded into a computer<br>who keeps the computer on the computers<br>keep the computers on<br>and then we’re part of this new life<br>this new world that exists inside a fucking machine<br>and that your consciousness exists in a machine<br>and what happens the original version of your<br>consciousness<br>what does gaia have planned for you after you die<br>do you really<br>go into some great well of souls and<br>you know and go into the next stage of existence<br>does that happen<br>and if that does happen<br>you already downloaded into the machine<br>does the well of souls accept you<br>or the well souls does listen<br>bitch I don’t accept software priority up in heaven<br>you can’t be copying my shit and putting on bit<br>torrent down on earth<br>and having all these you know<br>come on man your time’s up bitch<br>it’s over you have to move on<br>you know maybe it doesn’t accept you<br>if there’s a version of you<br>running in this parallel dimension<br>maybe heaven won’t accept you because you gotta let go<br>like that’s the whole idea<br>of living and dying is to know that<br>this is a stage<br>don’t be greedy don’t try to<br>live for 1000 years just get the fuck out of here<br>go go go go don’t download yourself stop it<br>you know it’s almost like a kid<br>who wants to go down the slide<br>and he’s holding onto the bag of the slide<br>and he wants to go down the slide<br>and hold on at the same time<br>well you can’t<br>either you go down the slide<br>or you hold on you’d be a bitch<br>so either you<br>download yourself in a computer lift forever<br>or you see what’s next like like<br>you’re supposed to<br>right<br>aubrey de grey<br>believes we will live forever in biological form<br>yeah I’ve seen that guy that professor aubrey de grey<br>day sleeper nineteen eighty eight<br>he’s that crazy English dude with a big long<br>crazy beard who drinks a lot of beer<br>yeah he’s a fascinating guy he’s um<br>you know some crazy mad scientist genius character who<br>is working on<br>changing human beings at the molecular level level<br>to prevent aging<br>to change<br>aging and working on all these different science<br>for our anti aging<br>and the idea is that if you can survive like<br>you know for a few years next 20 or 30 years<br>you’re likely that you could live forever<br>just really crazy just insane to think about<br>like so many people as it is right now you know<br>did you see pandorum<br>by the way<br>unsolicited plug here<br>hold on 2nd ladies and gentlemen<br>I’m gonna grab this bitch<br>so you know what the fuck I’m talking about<br>I watched this the other night on blu ray<br>it’s called pandorum and this is a movie that<br>kung li is in<br>and that’s I think<br>how I found out about it the first time<br>and then<br>a dude named angry amadeus on my message board<br>made a post about it<br>and he’s a pretty smart guy<br>and he was talking about how great it was<br>I said alright fuck it I’ll give it a try<br>that guy is an intelligent dude and it’s a<br>space<br>horror film and kung li is in it dennis quaid is in it<br>and pretty goddamn fucking good movie man<br>what is it pretty fun fucking movie<br>it’s a horror movie in space<br>kind of surprised that it didn’t get<br>more people into it it was good<br>what’s the rotten tomato score<br>I didn’t even look let’s look<br>the rotten tomato score for pandoram<br>I pretty much trust that shit<br>rotten tomatoes yeah<br>it’s pretty good pretty accurate usually<br>what do I think about the nexus one<br>I think it’s got a lot of problems now<br>but once it comes to verizon<br>it might be interesting to see what happens<br>I’m kind of more excited about the tortu now I think<br>yeah you know the thing about the tortu<br>which means a lot to me is that<br>it’s a world phone<br>I need a world for my travel bitch<br>I’m international<br>and I’m saying sometimes I’ll be busy in my homies<br>in the uk whoa 28% I’m not tomatoes 28% damn consensus<br>while it might<br>prove somewhat satisfying for devout sci fi fans<br>pandorum’s bloated derivative plot<br>ultimately leaves it drifting in space<br>okay I completely disagree<br>yes it was not perfect nor was avatar<br>I’m not looking for perfect movies anymore<br>I’m looking for an escape I’m looking for some fun<br>if I want to be intellectually stimulated<br>it’s not gonna be from your gay fucking movie<br>okay<br>it’s gonna be from a documentary it’s gonna be from<br>some real life shit<br>it’s gonna be from something on space<br>if I’m watching a movie<br>I want crazy shit<br>with monsters and explosions and I want excitement<br>and I want some tits<br>and that movie had all that<br>click on top critics and read some of the top little<br>hot bitch was kicking over his ass<br>top critics yeah<br>and then read some of the just little blurbs from what<br>their reviews are<br>because I’m kind of interested to see if<br>because if you like it so much<br>what they have to say about it<br>thanks for the tip<br>hmm<br>throughout<br>throughout some obvious questions pop up immediately<br>yeah no kidding<br>jesus christ folks<br>lazily derivative<br>perhaps perhaps a bit<br>but so what man<br>it’s like a fucking cheeseburger<br>way too much tori amos<br>soundtrack how dares ah now we know did they say that<br>my tory listen folks<br>yeah it’s the you know what I’m looking forward to<br>the wolf man okay<br>the wolf man with benicio del toro’s coming out<br>I know the fucking plot<br>I know it’s been done 1000

certain sixties and the seventies<br>they had a certain energy to their music<br>that like<br>what was representing the changes that were going on<br>the culture that we haven’t had in a long time<br>the thing about jimi hendrix<br>and the thing about the doors and the beetles<br>and all the zeppelin<br>the bands from that era is<br>like they really were<br>they were bursting to the scene and one of the most<br>one of the biggest changes in our human culture ever<br>like between the fifties and<br>the seventies<br>shit just went<br>haywire and whacked out of fucking control<br>and all

a lot of rape jokes<br>lot of positional dominance<br>I’m very good at guard passing<br>I know what the fuck I’m doing<br>guard passing<br>it’s funny how you know<br>you can date one girl and<br>think that like it’s cool to choke girls<br>because that’s what they want<br>like choking choking like what I don’t like that at all<br>I don’t like that that’s confusing<br>now you don’t want it like that that was sex<br>ari ari she fear<br>yeah ari loves that he likes smacking girls too<br>yeah but it’s like slapping him in real life<br>yeah like slapping him when he’s boning him<br>I don’t want to connect those two things together<br>violence and sex<br>because I think you can connect things<br>in your head<br>you can set up little pathways and like it or not<br>they’re in there you know<br>I think sometimes dudes get obsessed with feet<br>you know I don’t know what the fuck<br>is that all about but it’s a thing<br>and dudes get horny and excited about feet<br>well that same shit can happen with slapping people<br>duncan likes to be spanked<br>yeah<br>you could date a girl and she likes you to slap her<br>and then you get into that and you<br>guys have logo sex<br>because you’re slapper and then fuck her on the ass<br>and she’s nutty<br>and then you know that’s your shit<br>now like you’re all<br>fired up and the next girl you’re trying to slap her<br>and fuck her in the ass<br>so you fucking asshole<br>you piece of shit and you’ve ruined<br>like the best relationship ever<br>why because you’re addicted to ass<br>fucking and slapping bitches<br>and that’s just wrong<br>man I need to<br>get your shit together<br>it’s funny how different every girl is too<br>cause some girls just want to be fucking other girls<br>like why are you doing it so rough<br>you know<br>some girls they want you to lick their clip like this<br>right they want you to go like this<br>and other girls who want you to lock on that thing<br>fucking shake your head like a wolf<br>they want you to punch it<br>they want you to get crazy with it<br>they want you to asshole they want to go nutty<br>you know some girls want they want the whole thing<br>they want fingers<br>they want you to fuck their face they want nutty shit<br>but if you try that with other girls you got problems<br>son that’s why I just let them take control<br>sometimes you gotta take a chance<br>sometimes you gotta roll the dice but you gotta know<br>how freaky a girl is<br>and some girls would have never done it before<br>but you just tried it<br>and then all sudden your party’s on<br>I would recommend as a man of experience in it<br>in his elder years<br>don’t get all excited about that ass fucking<br>that shit is not sanitary it’s not good for anybody<br>it’s only it doesn’t feel better<br>it’s just cause it’s taboo<br>that’s nutty that’s a trick<br>and it’s unsanitary<br>and you can ruin your wife’s butthole right<br>you could break that shit<br>they’re all gonna have problems shitting with like<br>20 years well you know dude when they get old due to<br>our gay a lot of gay dudes just go with the blow job<br>blow job jerking each other off<br>they give up their ass fucking yeah a lot of gay dudes<br>they’re like you don’t target your asshole pounded<br>some big dick lexington steel type character<br>ripping your asshole apart<br>you know and there’s a lot of that online<br>we were talking about<br>that about how easy it is to see porn online<br>like ass fuck porn<br>pam like within a couple clicks<br>you know all you have to do is just<br>put it in

on those types<br>I wonder<br>man because they’re still filming a lot of them<br>derek’s always working<br>I wonder where I mean maybe<br>websites are eventually going to start<br>sponsoring their own porn<br>you know well<br>that’s why I say<br>most porn stars have gone to doing their own<br>webcam type no<br>but what I meant was<br>websites getting exclusive content deals with<br>porn stars of filming their own porns<br>you know<br>and like people get to writing suggestions you know<br>hey I want to watch<br>jesse james suck<br>lexington steals dick on a boat<br>wearing a Japanese samurai outfit<br>and okay we’re gonna film that<br>and they film that and put it online<br>I would never pay for it<br>there’s never even a pay for it<br>well you wouldn’t pay for it<br>but if you felt like you were creating it<br>you know maybe if it’s like when those build a shoe<br>websites where you can put your own<br>purple stripe on your night<br>if you go to your stream at night<br>you can find the same ship for free<br>man there’s a whole way<br>maybe this is the future how about this<br>maybe the future is<br>people will fuck live in front of you<br>you can tell them what to do<br>yeah but they do that right<br>they already<br>do that though no but I mean like hot chicks<br>yeah I mean there’s pretty good hot chicks come on<br>there’s a lot of websites that do that<br>girls like sit in front of the tv<br>there’s sit in front of the laptop<br>and then you go out tuck<br>it’s cocky yeah<br>that happens all the time it happens every day<br>yeah that’s been happening for a long time<br>there used to be thing whatever that pouch costs<br>this guy’s a dirty pervert<br>pow talk is that that’s all pile talk is<br>it’s people having sex going like<br>there’s like people that like<br>people to watch them have sex really<br>and people are just sitting there like<br>ah do it in her bud<br>and he’s like wow<br>and they do that<br>yeah that’s been happening since it’s like

on justin tv<br>it’s on where the lengths<br>there’s actually links<br>there’s somebody posted a couple weeks<br>I want to watch people fuck<br>what isn’t about about fucking that’s so private<br>you know<br>it’s funny it’s like we want to do it so badly<br>everybody lives for it<br>we all acknowledge that we all live for it<br>but if anybody catches you doing it<br>anybody catches you engaging in that sort of pleasure<br>it’s so intimate revealing about you<br>it’s like we’re so terrified of revealing things<br>about ourselves<br>and that’s the big one<br>it’s people seeing you fuck<br>people seeing you know you suck someone’s pussy<br>people<br>seeing you fuckstone girl and ever suck your dick<br>oh crazy that’s craziness<br>you know there’s something about that that people<br>people

like they<br>could just do it perform in front of everybody<br>like dudes get creeped out<br>but if a guy<br>you’re at a party and everybody’s having a good time<br>it’s over your house<br>and this dude just goes crazy and pulls a stick<br>on this girl starts sucking it right at your party<br>you’re gonna like be uncomfortable<br>it’s gonna be nervous right<br>mmm why is that<br>because<br>if he

hanging out<br>pussies hanging out because we’re just gonna fuck<br>you’re just gonna make too many people<br>even in like hot weather<br>it’s totally unacceptable<br>to walk<br>around naked everywhere and just start fucking people<br>at the supermarket<br>but that’s what would happen<br>if everybody was naked<br>if you lived in Florida but it’s 110 degrees<br>you don’t have to wear fucking clothes okay<br>and if there was no laws against wearing clothes<br>people just start walking on naked<br>people would fuck everywhere<br>they’d be fucking in bushes and trees<br>they’d fucking the car<br>there’d be<br>chicks sucking guys dicks while they were driving<br>everywhere you looked it would be going on<br>would be everywhere<br>there would be way<br>more crashes from getting your dick<br>suck driving than it would<br>be from twittering or from texting while driving<br>or it might be the exact opposite<br>and you’re seeing people’s floppy tits everywhere<br>you like oh look these oh floppy tits everywhere<br>I can’t see this floppy tits<br>yeah that’ll annoy you for about a day<br>and then you’re gonna want to get your dick sucked<br>all right trust

exceptions<br>but almost universally<br>we’ve accepted the fact that girls harry is not sexy<br>right right<br>I don’t think so<br>I think the fucking harry is disgusting<br>that’s gonna have it like on their back<br>it’s not amazing though<br>but it’s amazing that we make girls take<br>stuff off their body that grows naturally<br>to perpetrate some new look<br>some new sleeker model that’s coming in the future<br>that’s less monkey<br>you know that’s clearly what we’re trying to do<br>when you’re in the shaved pussies and shaved legs and<br>even when dudes shave themselves down<br>and get all oiled up and<br>try to look all sexy<br>what you’re trying to do is you’re trying to get as far<br>away from the monkey as possible<br>you’re becoming some sleek<br>you know almost like silver surfer

everywhere his back his arm<br>he had been in a bunch of movies too<br>because he’s such a character<br>such a unique looking guy<br>but man<br>if there’s anybody that ever looked more like an ape<br>I mean he’s so hairy<br>like that’s why his nickname worked<br>I mean if it was the same guy<br>but you shaved all that hair off<br>you couldn’t call him george’s animal steel<br>it wouldn’t be

okay<br>girls who have like a real juicy ass all right<br>that real the real wide hip small ways<br>those girls are freaks okay<br>that’s why guys are attracted to them<br>they have so much hormones in their body<br>they have so much going on<br>those girls are horny as fuck it’s nature<br>little wings big ass<br>that’s why you’re attracted to them because they’re<br>the most capable of giving birth<br>they have birthing hips and we find those attractive<br>and they have enough<br>fat on the ass to ensure that they’re gonna survive<br>during the pregnancy<br>we like that we like a little

to be in it we try to nail it<br>it’s being a certain way and being healthy and<br>smelling good<br>and also being a certain shape<br>there’s like women want a certain shape to men<br>there’s guys who get like pecking plants<br>because they can’t grow<br>they<br>don’t grow muscle very well I guess and they try to do<br>a lot of bench pressing<br>they get lazy and so they just stick these<br>plastic things in their chest<br>and make their own boobs grow out<br>and they have thanks for their arms too<br>and for their calfs<br>to make their bodies look bigger<br>I mean it’s all craziness<br>it’s
