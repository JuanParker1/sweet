better help<br>com trojan horse<br>this is my first story as a journalist<br>I hadn’t planned for it to be my last story<br>but it probably will be<br>given what’s happened in the gears<br>I’ve been working on this<br>it’s about a letter that surfaced in my city<br>and had huge consequences for brain<br>this letter launched four government investigations<br>change our national policy and ended careers<br>it’s hurt some of the country’s most vulnerable<br>children<br>a letter that many people who’ve seen it agree<br>is ridiculous<br>unsigned undated<br>then it looked like a serious document<br>it just seemed comical<br>like what the hell is this<br>I remember looking at some time<br>thinking why on earth is this<br>the infamous letter<br>was it written on parchment in blood<br>so you’re presenting me with a<br>document that turned our live upside down<br>I first learned at the letter in 2014<br>I wasn’t a journalist then I was a doctor who’d quit<br>medicine living in Birmingham england<br>making my breakfast at 1:00pm<br>listening to the news<br>when I heard about the discovery<br>of a secret communicate<br>between muslim extremists<br>they were discussing a plot<br>to infiltrate our CD schools<br>and run them on strict islamic principles<br>potentially with the aim of radicalizing students<br>someone had forwarded the letter anonymously<br>to the local government<br>the birman city council<br>but was missing the first and last page<br>so it’s unknown exactly who wrote it<br>or who they were sending it to<br>according to the intercepted pages<br>the plot had a codename<br>operation trojan horse<br>I have to admit<br>when this story about muslims and bermigum first broke<br>as a muslim and bermigum<br>I was alarmed<br>it sounded possible<br>kids across britain across europe<br>were flying off to Syria to join this group<br>called isis<br>and bermigham has been home to quite a few terrorists<br>my neighbor was a terrorist<br>the guy who killed five people<br>and then tried to run into parliament with a knife<br>he did his planning in a flat above the<br>persian restaurant across the street from me<br>so I wasn’t surprised watching<br>as over the next several months<br>operation<br>trojan horse snowballed into a huge national story<br>a number<br>of schools in Birmingham have been infiltrated to buy<br>hard line muslim headlines like islamist plot<br>jihadist plot<br>alleging a conspiracy by orphan<br>and the government responded with full force<br>the prime minister got involved<br>convening his cabinet to discuss the<br>threat<br>the national government<br>sent in a bunch of investigators<br>including scotland yards<br>form a head of count to terrorism<br>to look into two dozen schools<br>in majority of muslim aries of bimingham<br>like I said was all very frightening<br>until a few months later<br>when the various investigators<br>finally start reporting their findings<br>that found no plot called operation trojan horse<br>that seen no science that anyone had been radicalized<br>no evidence of violence or planned violence<br>they didn’t bring any territory charges<br>against anyone working at the scores that looked into<br>but despite all of them<br>despite finding no plot<br>investigators still concluded that something terrible<br>was happening in Birmingham schools<br>the letter helped them uncover<br>that muslims had influenced the schools<br>in a dangerous way<br>government officials snapped into action<br>things that should<br>not have happened in our schools<br>were allowed to happen<br>our children were exposed to things<br>they should not have been exposed to<br>the fallout has been huge<br>prime minister david cameron as we said is<br>calling a special meeting<br>of the government’s extremism task force<br>officials removed educators<br>revamped schools and renamed them<br>they mandated all schools in the country<br>start teaching what they termed british values<br>to make kids less susceptible to extremist ideas<br>their beefed up britain’s count to extremism laws<br>by making public sector workers like<br>teachers and doctors<br>part of the state surveillance apparatus<br>to now inform<br>on their co workers and students and patients<br>today if you stop<br>someone on the streets of britain<br>and ask them<br>what happened in burmingham schools in 2014<br>if they follow the news they’d likely tell you<br>that a bunch of muslims were up to no good<br>there is another version of the story though<br>it’s one less told and far less popular<br>that version of the trojan horse affair<br>is that nothing happened<br>that these bearded brown educators were set up<br>and the nation fell for it<br>but it’s always seemed to me<br>that there’s a simple way to figure out<br>what really happened here<br>the letter<br>even with all the government inquiries<br>no authority<br>none of the investigators ever figured out who wrote it<br>remarkably none of them even tried<br>and that to me<br>seemed like a pretty clearing oversight<br>the reason<br>that country was looking at these schools of suspicion<br>the reason they were investigating them at all<br>was because this dodgy letter showed up<br>portraying the people who worked there<br>as nefarious plotters<br>claiming they were sneaking islam into schools<br>like a trojan horse<br>the letter is what put the idea in authorities heads<br>so I didn’t see how you could know<br>what operation trojan horse was<br>or wasn’t<br>unless you got to the bottom of the trojan horse data<br>who wrote it and why<br>a few years later<br>I decided to go to school for investigative journalism<br>but my professor wasn’t completely sold<br>on a story I wanted to report from my student project<br>operation trojan horse<br>this was investigative journalism<br>he wanted me to announce something new<br>not rake over some years old story<br>as a doctor though<br>I’m familiar with the concept of a second opinion<br>so the night before my masters were set to start<br>I went looking for one<br>a doctor came to see me for a second opinion<br>one night in fall 2017 I’m in a theater in Birmingham<br>after my podcast s town came out<br>I went around doing some q amp a’s<br>afterwards people sometimes come back staged chat<br>and so this guy comes in<br>introduces himself as hamza scied<br>he said he was changing careers to become a reporter<br>he was beginning a master’s program<br>an investigative journalism the next day actually<br>and he wanted some advice<br>he was speaking fast<br>like I might walk away at any moment<br>to be fair I was told that I had 5min with brian reed<br>after which I’d be scorched at the building<br>I did not know that<br>anyway hamza ran through the trojan horse story for me<br>elevator pitch style<br>I’d never heard of it but a guy was with backstage<br>a producer I know from the bbc he had<br>and he jumped in as hamza was talking yeah<br>yeah trojan horse<br>he said that was a big thing<br>a while ago some bad stuff went down<br>muslim educators had been up to no good<br>but it was cleared up<br>old story<br>there was something hamza said though<br>which afterwards I couldn’t get out of my head<br>he kept talking about a letter<br>which had set off this whole cascade of consequences<br>whose origins were still a mystery<br>so when I got home to New York I read the letter<br>it looked like a caricature<br>of a missive between two terrorists<br>filled with islamophobic tropes about conniving<br>and scheming muslims<br>it’s missing pages<br>parts of it are too dark to read<br>like it got jammed in the xerox machine<br>it instructs the recipient to destroy it after reading<br>it struck me as a funky document<br>for a government to take seriously<br>especially because from what I read<br>the government<br>hadn’t even looked into who wrote the letter<br>or why<br>there was a strange lack of curiosity<br>about this instigating document<br>I thought to myself<br>seems like<br>somebody should try to figure out who wrote that thing<br>and then I thought well wait this<br>journalism students doing that<br>maybe I had to give him a hand<br>and here we are<br>years later at the end of dizzying<br>farcical and enraging investigation<br>in which one mystery led to another led to another<br>tracing this letter’s path of destruction<br>across multiple continents<br>in defiance of many unhappy officials<br>and some aggressive attempts<br>to shut our reporting down<br>from serial productions and the New York times<br>I’m brian reed<br>I’m home to say<br>presenting to you<br>the most elaborate student project ever<br>this is the trojan horse affair<br>I got the call from brian while I was in class<br>my phone started ringing from a New York number<br>I asked my professor if I could take it<br>he said no<br>I asked if I could go use a toilet he said yes<br>I answered<br>and brian told me he wanted in on my investigation<br>but that I would need a producer<br>I said he assure or casual<br>I had no idea what producer did<br>soon<br>he started getting in touch with missions for me to<br>complete<br>first one he’d secured a recorder for me in Birmingham<br>and said there was something I had to do<br>it was supposed to be a basic<br>bread and butter assignment<br>go record a meeting<br>hamza had seen an invent advertised called trojan horse<br>the facts<br>where some of the educators who had been accused of<br>carrying out the plot<br>would be speaking publicly<br>they insisted the trojan horse affair was just<br>an islamophobic<br>stitch up the event hashtag was trojan hoax<br>and they were trying to clear their names<br>they’d never gotten their lives back on track<br>after the story died down<br>they’ve lost their jobs and been made<br>into pariahs by the national media<br>but afterwards humza calls me<br>and says when he showed up at the spot<br>a community center at 5:00pm<br>the receptionist told him he’s been cancelled<br>defense been cancelled<br>did they give you any<br>well wait did they give you any other information<br>like what did they<br>no they said it’s been cancelled and<br>that was it<br>I said no this is you know I spoke to the<br>organizer a few days ago<br>they said yeah I got canceled today<br>so<br>I felt like an idiot<br>to be honest I stand there with this big<br>you know mike stand that looks like a fishing rod<br>I got my box of equipment<br>this can’t be a good omen<br>I thought to mess up your first journalism assignment<br>but then<br>more people started showing up confused like me<br>until a man<br>in one of those safety vests swings round the corner<br>tells us to follow him<br>and takes us up the stream to a wedding hall<br>where everyone is gathering<br>instead<br>it’s a lot of people maybe over 100<br>and as I explain to brian<br>while I’m setting up the microphone<br>I start catching all the whispers<br>in terms of what happened<br>and it turned out that the original venue<br>had received phone calls from the national newspaper<br>specifically this guy<br>nick timothy<br>he’s a like a reporter or a publisher or what is he<br>he’s a columnist I think for the telegraph<br>and not just any old columnist<br>nic timothy<br>used to be the chief of stuff to the prime minister<br>he was essentially teresa may’s right hand man<br>I spoke to the guy who ran the community center<br>who told me nictimity had actually emailed<br>not called<br>he wouldn’t let me see the email<br>but according to others at the meeting<br>the implication was<br>if you hold this event<br>I will associate you with extremists in the newspaper<br>and the community center pulled the plug<br>nictimity denies contact in the community center<br>and as he doesn’t know who did or what they said<br>but he wrote a triumphant column<br>about the planned meeting<br>which I’d missed because also on YouTube all day<br>watching instructional videos<br>and how to use my recorder<br>in which he noted quote<br>when the daily telegraph discovered this<br>and contacted the owners of the venue<br>their rightly canceled day<br>he went on to suggest the event organizers<br>were extremists<br>and described the proposed meeting as quote<br>a shocking attempt to deny the trojan horse candle<br>and quote the people behind trojan horse<br>are trying to do it all over again<br>and right under our noses<br>good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to<br>trojan horse or hoax the discussion and debate<br>so here they were<br>the teachers and school volunteers<br>allegedly behind operation Georgia horse<br>along with their defenders<br>academics and activists<br>and an educational barrister and a union leader<br>packed in this wedding hall instead<br>I am really really concerned<br>that simply holding a public open meeting like this<br>becomes controversial<br>just the fact<br>we are holding this meeting<br>seems to be an act of resistance right now<br>the people at this meeting called from inquiry<br>to correct the record on the trojah horse affair<br>they believed the government had set them up<br>so the fact that a former<br>chief of staff to the prime minister nick timothy<br>went out of his way<br>to attack a grassroots event a community center<br>years after the Georgia horse affair<br>it just reinforced their suspicion<br>and mine quite honestly<br>that there was something dodgy<br>the authorities were still keen to hide<br>and then it was like a witch hunt<br>the heads were rolling this way and that way<br>hamza sent me the recording of the meeting<br>I listened to it and I was interested to hear<br>that one of the people who got on stage and spoke<br>was the man named repeatedly<br>in the trojan horse letter<br>as the mastermind of operation trojan horse<br>the plot’s a legit ringleader<br>a long time school volunteer<br>named to hear alam<br>I’ve never been a danger to anyone<br>I’ve never hurt anyone I’ve never<br>have any police case against me or anything<br>of the kind I wasn’t running a plot<br>you know<br>we are very proud of what we didn’t is I do not regret<br>nor apologize for anything that I’ve done<br>there was nothing can dustine<br>hidden or sinister about what we were doing<br>we were very open<br>and very transparent<br>so when I landed in Birmingham to begin reporting<br>that’s who we decided to go to first<br>to hear alam we figured<br>we’re looking to find the source of this mysterious<br>letter minos will start with the guide out at<br>as an extremist plotter<br>is this about to be the first radio interview<br>you’ve ever done yeah<br>I need to be schooled before handmade<br>what do you mean like how so well I mean<br>if this is me flying solo I’d be like whatever<br>how to do it my style you know<br>but this is this is you know and what is your style<br>do you have a style I don’t know<br>I feel like I’m a lot<br>how many of these have you done and none<br>what have an idea in my head of what my style could be<br>I think you’re a lot more sensitive than I am<br>put it that way<br>sure I mean like you’re I’m the more sensitive one<br>so don’t you think so<br>I don’t know I don’t know you that well<br>I wonder what would be wearing<br>hello ill fitting button down shirt<br>kaki’s welcome thank you<br>we’re going to be in that room there this room<br>we kick off our shoes<br>he shows us to a room at the front of his place<br>sorry you have to sit on slightly uncomfortable chairs<br>there hams and I squeezed behind two school desks<br>meant for children<br>there are protractors lying around<br>a whiteboard with sketches of geometric shapes<br>a creative writing workbook titled descriptosaurus<br>tahirs converted this room from his garage<br>into a tiny makeshift classroom<br>where it appears he tutors students quietly<br>because one result of the treasure horse letter<br>is that the government has banned him<br>from every volunteering<br>or working officially in schools again<br>he hears in front of us in his office chair<br>confident aryodite<br>framed by his bookshelf filled with texts about islam<br>and british history<br>I pull a copy of the letter out of my backpack<br>you know it’s a completely anonymous letter undated<br>claiming that there is a plot to<br>take over<br>and islamize the schools in Birmingham led by thyralum<br>which is myself<br>but I speak from a vantage point<br>where I actually know the truth<br>I know the reality<br>to here denies being an extremist<br>he denies engineering a plot<br>he says the reality is that<br>rather than corrupting schools<br>as a radical conspirator<br>he a first generation immigrant<br>from a poor pakistani family<br>was responsible<br>for one of the most miraculous school turnarounds<br>in british education<br>until he says the letter arrived and destroyed him<br>the story of this turn around<br>it’s not a secret<br>it’s one the hair shed with jones before<br>not that he’s done much good<br>in terms of clearing his name<br>but this backstory does explain<br>why the trojan horse ladder was so persuasive<br>because the hair told us<br>some of what was in that letter was true<br>the hair begins the story one night in 1993<br>when he’s watching tv<br>and a show called his attention<br>I just happened to be just<br>lying on the sofa really and the program came on<br>it was a documentary part of the bbc series panorama<br>nine times at a 10 I would switch to something else<br>but I was just sitting there and I started watching<br>britain’s new underclass is asian and its muslim<br>a once title unit community is now in crisis<br>with drug abuse<br>crime and family breakdown on the increase<br>and the title of this documentary was underclass<br>in perda in tonight panorama we investigate<br>an underclass in perda<br>purder meaning you know cover<br>meaning a veil if you like<br>under class in the veil<br>yeah<br>in tonight’s program<br>we lift the veil on this new underclass<br>a report from<br>the documentary opens with shots of brown men<br>skulking around dark<br>cobblestone streets in a muslim neighborhood<br>in what the correspondent calls the muslim ghetto<br>at night it doubles as the local red light district<br>it’s a seedy world of vice and illicit drug dealing<br>lurking in the shadows is a new manningham phenomenon<br>the pakistani pimp<br>he’s like a regular pimp but in a cortha<br>part of the documentary takes place<br>and to hear his neighborhood in bermigum<br>caught alum rock on the east side of the city<br>it’s one of the poorest areas in england<br>and his majority pakistani and muslim<br>if you’re not from bermigum and you’re not brown<br>you may have heard that alum rock<br>is a great place to find a terrorist<br>if you’re not from Birmingham and you are brown<br>you’ll have heard elm rock<br>is a great place to find a wedding dress<br>admittedly this bbc documentary<br>is racist in a nineties tv kind of way<br>but it had a big impact on the hair<br>because it missed the awkward brown gazing<br>some truly sobering facts emerge<br>the presenter reports that<br>pakistani muslims are incarcerated<br>at this proportionally high rates<br>she says<br>they have some of the highest rates of joblessness<br>they’re suffering from devastating health issues<br>terrible housing domestic violence<br>with one underlying cause of it all<br>a lack of education<br>this is a number I found more shocking<br>about 20% of white students were leaving school<br>without any qualifications<br>meaning they felt past exams<br>that would essentially<br>be the equivalent of a high school diploma<br>in the us<br>and that rape<br>was roughly the same for most people of color as well<br>but for pakistanis and bangladeshis and astonishing 50%<br>hold no qualifications whatsoever<br>fifty percent<br>half of us were basically failing school<br>that hit the hair hard<br>that the extent of education failure was<br>so bad<br>that we were at risk of creating an underclass of<br>muslims<br>who were basically uneducated<br>prone to crime and unemployment<br>so I kind of sat there and I<br>it made me feel guilty actually<br>guilt because<br>I was one of the few people who made it<br>from my family one of the first ones to make it into<br>university and to have a good job and so on<br>but there was also<br>a sense of humiliation<br>really because I was from this community<br>the hair’s family important to england in the seventies<br>when lots of people from<br>kashmir were moving here<br>largely because<br>the british design is huge dam<br>that flooded swaths of land<br>and displays tens of thousands of people<br>and one solution the brits got behind<br>was to invite displaced pakistanis over to england<br>so they could improve the british economy<br>by working in british factories and mills<br>which is what the hair’s dad did<br>the hair arrived in england as a nine year old<br>who didn’t speak any English<br>and would have become fluent for several years<br>I knew one word of English only<br>which was f o r<br>d<br>I mean I don’t know XYZ<br>but I know f o r d that’s it<br>I can really<br>I couldn’t speak any English when I first came here<br>all right I couldn’t even speak ford<br>I was just like mute football<br>that’s what I knew football<br>that’s right<br>so that’s how you arrived here and the first school<br>when I came here we<br>we arrived in bedroom is growing up<br>angry and alienated from white society<br>now the hair watched<br>as a documentary captured the next generation<br>park signing kids who were born in brain<br>being educated in state schools<br>still struggling to read<br>not able to recall basic English words<br>the camera cuts to a park in bermingham<br>he looked at the hair like warden park<br>which is right across from where he went to school<br>in annum rock<br>I recognize the park<br>maybe he was used to go and play there and<br>then I saw some children as at all<br>that’s our neighbor’s children<br>I recognize the kids here<br>even though it’s from a distance<br>but I recognize who the kids are<br>we filmed an encounter with two asian lads in a park<br>in a muslim quarter of Birmingham<br>these asian lads<br>we use asian to mean south asian by the way<br>they’re skipping school<br>and the hero knew which school they were skipping<br>there’s a one he’d gone to as a kid<br>right next to that park<br>parkview school<br>another majority muslim school<br>with miserable academic results<br>it’s a secondary school<br>age is 11 to 16<br>there’s a school where the hero had done well<br>enough to make it to college<br>and then university<br>before getting a good job in tennic communications<br>the documentary made him realize<br>how rare his success was<br>and how little he’d done with it<br>so tahir decided to do something<br>he started a tutoring program for<br>kids in the neighborhood<br>but what he was really interested in<br>was volunteering at his old school parkview<br>on what’s known as their governing body<br>in england<br>a governing body oversees how a school is run<br>like a corporate board does a company<br>it’s sort of like a school board in the us<br>except it’s specific to one school<br>they can have a lot of influence<br>so anyway tahir says one afternoon<br>a couple of park few parents he didn’t know<br>knocked on his door<br>we hear you’re interested in<br>becoming a governor they said<br>it was like they’d read his mind<br>though actually<br>to hear have been talking<br>about wanting to be a governor at a recent wedding<br>and these parents got wind of it<br>resentment and frustration<br>had been festering for<br>years among parents in alam rock<br>who been trying and trying<br>to get the authorities to do something<br>about the dismal schools<br>these parents at tahir’s door<br>had joined the park through governing body<br>in an attempt to make<br>a change but they didn’t speak fluent English<br>and hadn’t gone to university<br>tahir was a professional with a degree<br>who still lived in the neighborhood<br>we’d love to propose you they told him<br>and with that<br>tahir found himself at the next governing body meeting<br>of parkview school<br>being voted in not only as a member but as the chair<br>so that’s when I became a governor<br>on the 7th January 1997<br>you remember the date<br>yeah well I was to remain there for 18 years<br>when to hear started<br>parkfue<br>was one of the worst secondary schools in the country<br>only 4% of students were passing 4%<br>the national school inspection agency<br>had recently placed the school into special measures<br>the lowest possible ranking<br>an emergency status basically<br>meaning park view was in danger of being shut down<br>there were brawls breaking out in the schoolyard<br>on a tour of the building<br>to hear saw vandalized bathrooms with stalls<br>missing locks and toilets missing seats<br>but where to hear really trained his focus<br>was on the complacent teachers and administrators<br>we initially just started by saying that<br>obviously children should be achieving higher<br>that the achievement was not acceptable<br>and the fact that the school was to blame<br>for the failure<br>this statement so obvious to to hear<br>that the kids in alam rock were<br>capable of kids anywhere<br>was met with massive resistance<br>it was very difficult getting the school to accept that<br>they were the problem<br>people didn’t want to accept that because they were<br>they’ve been blaming the community for<br>maybe two decades<br>they had such a low expectation of children<br>one thing to hear noticed early on<br>was that the staff of this school<br>with nearly 90% pakistani students<br>had only one full time pakistani muslim teacher<br>so to here begin searching<br>for more muslim staff and governors<br>he gave presentations held workshops<br>he became a fixture at events around you sperming him<br>standing behind his little table or booth<br>evangelizing<br>for people to get involved in their local schools<br>I loved it<br>I loved it with the children because<br>I felt as I could make a difference<br>this is moz who’s saying<br>the first muslim teacher to hear hired<br>he taught math<br>I could use my language<br>my background while<br>understanding of where they come from<br>to make a difference<br>I knew their families<br>mars can point to a specific moment by the way<br>when he decided to go into teaching<br>there’s a panorama program<br>it’s called an underclass in part of that<br>powerful segment<br>mauso sane says from the very beginning<br>he encountered serious prejudices<br>among the most white stuff<br>I had a group of children come to me<br>and they said look this is one teacher in school<br>you always calls us pakis<br>he’s calling us pakis<br>he’s doing it in a joggy way but we find the offensive<br>they’re not able to tell anyone else<br>but they’re telling me<br>that look is easy sweating at us<br>that’s a slum in any context<br>but especially shocking for a teacher<br>to say to pakistani students<br>must told him<br>I think the best thing to do<br>have your parents write the score<br>he talked them through the procedure for doing them<br>in case their parents were known<br>he says eventually<br>the school looked into the teacher’s behavior<br>and while you’re investigating<br>he designed and he gave his final leaving speech<br>in the staff room and goes<br>it should be our culture domina in this school<br>not the kids<br>and he finished off with the words the west is the best<br>and all teachers clapped<br>all teachers clapped<br>the racism was pervasive<br>roswan forraz a former governor and math teacher<br>says it one of his first governing body meetings<br>he was shown a list of places<br>the students had been given work placements<br>through a program at the school<br>and it was all restaurants<br>supermarkets clothing stores<br>and there was no<br>Surgery Dr Surgery<br>or<br>law firm or anything like that<br>and I said you know how is it that<br>did the children decide these<br>and roswan says the vice chair told them well<br>their parents want them<br>to go and become doctors and engineers and etc<br>but reality is these kids will become taxi drivers<br>shopkeepers so we’ve got to prepare them now<br>and<br>for a good while I was<br>struggling to process what he was saying<br>this is me<br>a brown person<br>a muslim and he’s saying to me that<br>they deserve to have these kind of jobs<br>this is this community’s role in society<br>that’s right<br>we just failed the kids we just failed the kids and<br>didn’t even feel bad about it<br>didn’t even we didn’t even feel guilty<br>john brockley was one of the non<br>muslim teachers at parkview<br>he was a math teacher who’d been there since<br>the eighties<br>he was frank with us<br>about the bigotry that he and his colleagues held<br>towards the students and their families<br>we thought that we were a superior culture<br>and<br>we looked down<br>we looked down<br>on these people who didn’t know about education<br>you’re talking about yourself here<br>I’m talking about myself but I’m also talking about<br>you know many of the people that I work with<br>the teachers attitudes are documented by the way<br>a former head teacher of parkview<br>a head teacher is what we americans call a principal<br>did a master’s thesis while he was at<br>the school<br>for which he collected opinions from the staff<br>including from john<br>as to why muslim children<br>were drastically under performing<br>compared to their peers<br>in the thesis<br>teachers say the kid’s parents are ignorant<br>wrongly claim the students don’t speak English<br>the teachers try for a while<br>one teacher said<br>but end up feeling like who gives a dam<br>that’s a quote<br>it makes john cringe to think back on it<br>it’s only when you move away<br>from a situation like that that<br>you can realize how awful it is<br>I don’t normally think about<br>about this sort of thing because I’m<br>just too embarrassing<br>once we created the shift in the belief of the teachers<br>then the job became much easier<br>the hair says<br>by the early two thousands park view was changing<br>the school began taking basic but transformative steps<br>setting individualized achievement<br>pockets for each student<br>that followed them from gate year<br>and preparing students for qualifying exams which<br>amazingly hadn’t happened before<br>school started awarding trophies for good marks<br>inviting parents to ceremonies when they kids did well<br>here in the governors hired a new head teacher<br>a non wisdom woman from a girl school<br>who embraced park views new aspirations<br>tess score started to rise<br>students were heading to college<br>park view’s reputation was turning around<br>but there are other changes<br>the hair and suited their park view<br>which later officials would view a suspect<br>changes that investigators would point to<br>as a trademarks of operation

equivalent of a regular public school<br>in the us<br>and since<br>98% of the children happened to be of the slumming<br>faith background<br>we obviously are catering for<br>the constituency that the school serves<br>in line with the regulatory<br>requirements<br>to hear a scribe to an educational philosophy<br>that the way he and other parkview staff talk about<br>it reminds me of aphor<br>centric or black excellent schools in the us<br>that students will do better academically<br>when their schools incorporate and celebrate<br>who they are and there’s research that backs us up<br>so under to hears leadership<br>park view allowed students to pray if they wanted<br>they installed facilities for wudu<br>the ablutions you do before prayers<br>they celebrated ramadan<br>and altered the schedule during that month<br>to facilitate fasting<br>they served to allow food<br>and I felt that you know this was our school<br>I mean we were proud to say that this is our school<br>we wanted our children to say that this was<br>their school and that they were proud of it<br>in the wake of the trojan horse letter<br>government officials would declare<br>that the way the hair and his colleagues were running<br>park view score<br>had undermined unquote british values<br>that they were limiting the children’s ability<br>to thrive in modern britain<br>which is an interesting<br>charge to bring against the hair<br>because I have to say<br>I haven’t personally met an English pakistani more<br>confident than his british<br>than to hear<br>deciding whether not to cause a british is a fraud and<br>personal thing<br>for us speaking for myself<br>even though I came to england when I was eight<br>and became a british citizen with a british passport<br>even though I have a british education<br>when to british university<br>worked for britain’s national health service<br>I didn’t call myself brush<br>I was never precious about nationality<br>so I didn’t really care what I was called<br>but sure I’d also picked up on a subliminal messaging<br>that in order to be proper british you had to be white<br>the here on the other hand<br>not only calls himself british<br>but does so proudly<br>I got to talk into the hair by this one day<br>he and bryan and I were getting tea<br>at my favorite chi shop<br>on an alum rock road<br>this is the hangout<br>and as we sat outside<br>in one of the main thoroughfares of islamic britain<br>around the corner from where the hair grew up<br>with double decker buses<br>passing by sweet shops and<br>fabric stores and a lot of chippies<br>I told him my reason for why I’d find him only recently<br>started calling myself brush<br>for a long time<br>I never call myself brush as by 13<br>I’ve been reading a book about the british empire<br>and I learned how rich India which<br>at the time included Pakistan was<br>according to some economists<br>before the bridge took control<br>I believe the statistic is<br>roughly it controlled about the 24% or something<br>out of the world’s economy<br>at the time<br>3% of world’s economy is a richest nation in the world<br>24% of the world’s economy<br>is roughly what the us controls today<br>I know this is somewhat<br>apples and oranges comparison because<br>the world wasn’t organized<br>into a globalized economy back then<br>but it does show how rich India was<br>in relation to other countries at the time<br>when the british left the indian subcontinent<br>after some 200 years of economic exploitation<br>indian Pakistan<br>were among the poorest nations in the world<br>I didn’t learn this stuff in school because<br>britain’s colonization of a quarter of the planet<br>is not a compulsory part of the national curriculum<br>which why I only discovered it as an adult<br>that so much of the wealth I saw in britain<br>was actually extracted from the place I come from<br>so from that point on I started quite myself british<br>I was just like I’m british I own this country<br>this is my money with which you have raised everything<br>around me yeah<br>so I mean that’s very similar to the position I<br>arrived at except for me proclaiming ambrash<br>is somewhat by finger in the eye<br>but here it’s sincere<br>it also came to him later in life<br>he says<br>he was an event held by a british most demognization<br>and they began saying very clearly<br>you’re never going back to Pakistan<br>your children are never going to move back<br>it’s not gonna<br>it’s not gonna happen<br>that’s what you have been thinking up to that point<br>yeah because our parents spoke like that to us<br>our homes are in Pakistan<br>we are Pakistani parents spoke to us like that my<br>father never told me we are british<br>because that’s not<br>what he felt he believed in Pakistan most of his life<br>why would he say that<br>so the people at this event were saying<br>you live here now<br>we were part of this country and that<br>it was important<br>as muslims we should benefit to this country<br>so ever since then I’ve been kind of<br>dissing the idea that we are other<br>that we are outsiders that we don’t belong here<br>islam is part of Russian<br>it’s not alien<br>I don’t accept that<br>can you see so this is why<br>so for here<br>not only was incorporating islam into the school<br>and academic strategy<br>it was also a british value<br>it was really nice to me it was<br>doing something at home and at my school is happening<br>yeah like I didn’t want<br>to have a different life at school<br>like if I’m<br>if I’m praying at home I want to pray at school too<br>because these are<br>two students who graduated from parkview in 2014<br>we’re not using their names because<br>such as the stink of the trojan horse scandal<br>they don’t want potential employers<br>to know where they went to school<br>they actually keep it off their resumes<br>when homs and I met them<br>four years after they graduated<br>they were both sitting law at university<br>some of the first in their families<br>to go on to higher education<br>they’ve been best friends in school<br>the kind of friends who don’t need words to communicate<br>are you talking about<br>yeah I don’t know if I should<br>which is<br>the students told us about these assemblies<br>they would have in the mornings<br>which included religious<br>teachings and sometimes prayer<br>this is something<br>that as an american made me do a double take<br>when I first heard about it<br>the idea of teachers in a public school<br>leading prayers during an assembly<br>is not normal to us<br>but in britain there’s no separation<br>between church and state<br>the queen is head of both<br>so not only as prayer allowed in schools<br>some form of worship is legally mandated<br>in all schools that are publicly funded<br>schools don’t always adher to this<br>but students are supposed to take part<br>in what’s called a daily act of collective warship<br>by default<br>it’s supposed to be broadly christian and character<br>but schools can apply to change it to other faiths<br>if that better suits their students<br>which is what parkview did<br>it got approval for its worship to be islamic<br>the students told us at parkfu’s assemblies<br>they would sit in the main hall<br>and a teacher would tell parables or lessons<br>usually from islam<br>but other faiths too<br>do you guys remember<br>actually learning things in these assemblies<br>or did they make you think<br>or were they just kind of boring teachers<br>blah blah blah blah like like you know<br>I really enjoyed those things because um<br>I didn’t learn this from<br>anywhere else like<br>they still<br>remember this one assembly all these years later<br>about charity<br>talking about charity and they say<br>when you’re giving charity<br>put your hand in your pocket and take care<br>don’t care how much you give in and just put it in<br>don’t count<br>what you’re given and what you have left because<br>when you give you receive tenfold<br>and charity does not make you poor poor<br>quite literally<br>like sometimes when I like<br>see somebody<br>who’s like asking for many things like that<br>I’ll put my hand in<br>I’ll take it out I’ll take it out and I don’t discover<br>it just because I remember that one<br>teacher he literally said it like that like that game<br>so that you left<br>hand doesn’t even know what your right hand gave<br>yeah<br>when the hair became chair of park views governor body<br>in nineteen ninety seven<br>four percent of students were passing<br>by 2010 that number was 71%<br>a seventeenfold increase<br>we had not changed the children we had not changed<br>the parents but slowly but surely<br>we took the results<br>so that they were consistently in the seventies<br>which means the school actually is<br>kind of guaranteeing an outcome<br>parklee was now<br>actively preparing its students for the eventuality<br>that their academic success would lead them out<br>of east Birmingham<br>something that a lot of teachers said to me<br>you live in a bubble<br>again the former part of you students and I was like<br>what you mean<br>they were like you live in an asian community<br>you go to an asian school<br>you’re very safe<br>you don’t know what it’s like to brunch out<br>I remember we learned about<br>the population and how it’s divided in uk<br>and I think it was something like 2% of the population<br>in the uk is asian and I was like wow only 2%<br>I was like 2% how is it 2% like<br>everybody I know is asian<br>every person that I’ve come across is proud<br>how is that possible so it was so odd<br>the uk is actually 2% park sunny 7% asian<br>but point being<br>there was a vast majority of the population<br>that these students and their classmates<br>were not bumping into day to day<br>in alam rock<br>the school organized visits to Cambridge university<br>they took them on camping trips<br>they visited the houses of parliament in London<br>some students wanted a week<br>long trip on a sailboat with kids from all over<br>including a bunch of white kids<br>apparently we weren’t used to mingling<br>with people who would not pakistani<br>so they were exposing us to you guys<br>okay hi you’re looking at me<br>this is what they were preparing first for<br>parents clamored to get their kids into parkview<br>the school had a waiting list<br>we were you know<br>given all kinds of accolades nationally in the press<br>we had officials coming in and out of<br>our school really they’re saying what are you doing<br>you know perhaps we can learn something<br>and they invited us actually<br>that why don’t you support other schools<br>the hair became well regarded in education circles<br>in over the years he expanded his reach beyond parkview<br>back in Birmingham though<br>some people resented him<br>yeah he had made enemies a lot of schools in the ed<br>yeah he became like hated amongst a lot of people<br>mossus hayne<br>who became park views acting head teacher around this<br>time was a full support of their hairs<br>but still he<br>another former colleagues<br>told us they wished the hair was a bit more circumspect<br>in the way he went around to other schools<br>advocating for reform<br>it was self assured blunt<br>and particularly inspiring<br>when laying out for head teachers<br>and other school leaders<br>the way their schools were failing muslim students<br>to tell other schools<br>look puff you can do it puff you can do it<br>puff you can do it<br>same family same children that you got<br>they can do it that’s not an excuse<br>we used to tell tyre off for this a lot<br>stop using us as beating<br>stick because it’s isolating us amongst other schools<br>he was actually pointing the finger<br>and saying directly to had teachers<br>you’re not doing a good enough job here for these kids<br>jackie<br>he used used to be in charge of school improvement<br>for the birminge city council<br>and she says she can name head teachers<br>that she knows to hear made enemies with<br>many of them were used to having the final<br>word on academics<br>and then here was to hear<br>there’s volunteer<br>with no professional teaching experience<br>waltz again and criticizing their work<br>I mean actually people come to me and say<br>I can’t understand why you give ty here the time of day<br>he’s a terrible man<br>he said to me<br>blah blah blah blah and they would go sounding off<br>colleagues and friends want the hair<br>you might want to consider softening your approach<br>but the hair wasn’t having it<br>you have to fight for justice<br>justice not gonna be handed to you on the plate<br>you know you have to make space for yourself<br>so the fact that some people may not be okay with that<br>is a different user is irrelevant to me<br>you know that’s their problem<br>in 2012 park view received the ultimate validation<br>and what was probably its proudest moment in the hares<br>nearly 18 years there<br>often arrived for an inspection<br>and deemed the school outstanding<br>the highest rating possible<br>among the many things inspector sprays the park view<br>or the<br>wide range of opportunities for spiritual development<br>including voluntary Friday prayers<br>in his time as chero governors<br>the hero had taken parkview<br>from the lowest ranking the verge of closure<br>to the very top<br>the person in charge of offstead<br>chief inspector said quote<br>every school in the country should be like this<br>less than two years later<br>on November twenty seventh twenty thirteen<br>an envelope arrived<br>on the desk of the leader of Birmingham city council<br>a man named sir albert bore<br>inside was a cover sheet addressed to him<br>marked very important confidential<br>mister bore it said<br>this letter was found<br>when I was clearing my boss’s files<br>and I think you should be aware that I am shocked<br>at what your officers are doing<br>you have seven days to investigate this matter<br>after which it will be sent to a national newspaper<br>who I am sure will treat it seriously<br>sincerely a n<br>anonymous presumably<br>behind that note was the trojan horse letter<br>four poorly copied pages shadows at the edges<br>instructions to destroy after reading<br>the letter was written<br>as if from a collaborator of to hears<br>describing a conspiracy to here had been running<br>to take over and islamize schools by deception<br>it took weeks for to hear to learn about it<br>he heard rumors<br>there was a mysterious letter making its way<br>around Birmingham<br>around the city council into head teachers in town<br>which named him as the orchestrator of a plot<br>one of tahir’s friends rushed to his house to tell him<br>that he’d been getting a haircut over<br>on washwood heath road<br>and afterwards his friend’s barber<br>had beckoned him into the back room of the shop<br>and showed him a copy<br>tahir did not know what to make of it<br>finally he got a hold of the document himself<br>you know obviously I was thinking<br>what is the source of this letter<br>who wrote this letter<br>why<br>was this letter written is what’s ringing in my head<br>the front page was missing so there was no deer whoever<br>it just started<br>as if it had been going on for a page or more ready<br>and the letter ended mid sentence too<br>with the phrase I would also like<br>so there’s no sign off<br>which meant to here<br>couldn’t tell exactly who it was supposed to be to<br>or from<br>but whoever wrote the letter said explicitly<br>to hear and I<br>it’s supposed to be from<br>somebody who knows me well in vermingham<br>and is talking to somebody in<br>Bradford<br>another british city that’s home to a lot of muslims<br>he’s talking about to hear what he’s done here<br>we can do it over there<br>and he’s your friend or your association<br>yes yeah whoever it is yeah<br>can you keep reading just the first few paragraphs<br>okay operation trojan horse has been<br>carefully thought through<br>and is tried and tested within bermigum<br>tahir and I will be happy to support your efforts<br>in Bradford this is a long term plan<br>and one which we are sure will lead to great success<br>in taking over a number of schools and ensuring<br>that they are<br>run on the strict islamic principles in Birmingham<br>the benefits the main tactic of operation trojan horse<br>is to target head teachers at<br>the schools you want to take control of<br>to make their lives so miserable<br>that they’ll resign or else be fired<br>at which point you can install your own people<br>who will implant islamic extremism in the school<br>the author gives several examples of schools<br>in Birmingham<br>where to here<br>and his cronies<br>were supposedly in the middle of doing this<br>we have caused a great amount of organized disruption<br>in Birmingham<br>the letter says<br>and are on the way to getting rid of more head teachers<br>and taking over their schools<br>while sometimes the practices we use<br>may not seem the correct way to do things<br>you must remember that this is a jihad and as such<br>using all means possible to win the war is acceptable<br>what was your feeling or your attitude<br>were you laughing at it<br>were you actually kind of<br>taking it seriously and frightened<br>what were you<br>I mean I wasn’t laughing actually<br>because I knew the serious<br>nature of the allegations that were being made<br>but as far as they claimed those<br>themselves were concerned they were laughable<br>so I knew that there was something not right about it<br>what was going on here<br>to hear contacted the Birmingham city council<br>where the letter was first sent<br>he’d done training for them for years<br>and I said look<br>I work for you<br>and this letter apparently is going around<br>claiming certain things and<br>I’m surprised that you haven’t spoken to me to at<br>least to get my view on the matter<br>at least ask me to explain or if I know anything<br>or whatever or something<br>and<br>the gentleman they are actually from the city council<br>he said Mr Alam to be very honest with you<br>we don’t think anything of the letter<br>we think it’s a completely bogus hoax letter<br>and we don’t believe there is any truth in it<br>and therefore we didn’t take any action<br>we didn’t do anything with it<br>did you feel reassured by that or had not really know<br>because then the letter began to be printed<br>in the national media as well<br>someone leaked the letter to the Sunday times of London<br>and from there it became frenzy<br>one story turned to two<br>turned to dozens<br>in the daily mail the telegraph the spectator sky tv<br>many of them given credence to the letter<br>saying that extremist like the hare<br>had allegedly been infiltrating uk schools for years<br>reporters camped outside parkview<br>the stork to hear down the street<br>we tried to put these allegations to<br>the academy’s chair of governors<br>but to hear a Lamb turned about his house<br>hello hello Mr Lamb Mr Lamb<br>hello<br>the government kicked into key or two<br>investigate the swarmed park view<br>offstead the scudent spectra<br>arrived for two surprise inspections<br>and then we had the education<br>funding agency investigation<br>which was about<br>10 days I think<br>they were in there for 10 days<br>and<br>soon as they left<br>we had the pwc<br>price waterhouse coopers a big outside auditing firm<br>looking into the financial affairs of the school<br>so then we had them<br>for five weeks in the school as well<br>I said what are you looking for<br>I said play what are you looking for<br>you been here three weeks<br>you must have a family<br>there was more<br>the secretary of state for education<br>called an england’s former counter terror chief<br>from scotland yard<br>a man named peter clark<br>and the Birmingham city council appointed its own<br>special investigator<br>and they scrutinized parkview<br>along with 20 some odd other schools<br>and muslim neighborhoods<br>in the middle of the melee<br>some politicians and journalists<br>were saying that the letter itself was likely a hoax<br>there were some obvious factual inaccuracies<br>yet the government believed it<br>still warranted this action<br>honestly I don’t think any authority<br>explained this logic with much clarity at the time<br>but my understanding of how the thinking went<br>is that even if the letter itself<br>wasn’t an actual communique<br>between two real life conspirators<br>it could still be pointing at a real problem<br>even if it was fiction the thinking went<br>the letter could have been<br>fabricated by someone who had legitimate concerns<br>about muslim extremists<br>scheming and wielding influence in schools<br>and maybe the letter was their creative way<br>of raising an alarm<br>so rather than look into who wrote the letter and why<br>instead the government put out general public calls for<br>information about these schools<br>and people started coming forward mostly anonymously<br>with complaints<br>again investigators found no evidence of radicalization<br>no evidence of violent extremism<br>and no plot<br>what emerged instead was a kind of grab bag of islam<br>adjacent allegations<br>many of the same things<br>authorities had celebrated up to that point<br>but apparently now we’re seeing in a different light<br>like these<br>educators weren’t merely allowing students to pray<br>they were pressuring them to pray<br>they weren’t innocently recruiting brown muslim staff<br>they were hiring their buddies<br>who thought the same way as they did<br>and possibly discriminating<br>against non muslim candidates<br>in the process<br>school governors including to hear<br>they weren’t holding head teachers to a high standard<br>they were pressuring them harassing them<br>and exercising more power<br>than a governor was supposed to<br>investigators also<br>said they’d found instances of intolerance<br>torch lgbtq people<br>and unequal treatment of women and girls<br>they said parkview had held assemblies<br>and invited speakers<br>with anti western views<br>and that to hear and people align with him<br>allegedly subscribed to quote<br>an intolerant<br>and politicized form of extreme social conservatism<br>that claims to represent and ultimately seeks to<br>control all muslims<br>all of this<br>as the then secretary of state for education put it<br>as she presented<br>the findings on the trojan horse letter to parliament<br>meant that students<br>instead of<br>enjoying a broadening and enriching experience<br>at school<br>young people are having their horizons narrowed<br>and are being denied<br>the opportunity<br>to flourish in a modern multicultural britain<br>them face it is for this reason<br>and with deep sense of injustice and sadness<br>but today we are announcing our intention<br>to resign our positions<br>at parpu educational trust<br>and allow new members to assume responsibility<br>after months of scrutiny in early July 2014<br>to hear looking tired and stressed<br>stood at electron outside parkviewsgates and resigned<br>tahir told us he and the other park view governors<br>only agreed to do that<br>because the department for education<br>promised that the head teacher and other<br>on the ground leadership of the school<br>would be kept in place<br>but soon as<br>school opened in September<br>all of those people who were suspended<br>all the leadership was basically sacked ruthlessly<br>they went about destroying their careers<br>destroying their reputations<br>and they did that systematically<br>we had worked for 10 15 years really<br>to build this school<br>they destroyed it within months<br>the government renamed the school<br>it’s no longer parkview<br>it also notified<br>nearly every teacher and governor you just heard from<br>to here included<br>that it was bringing proceedings to ban them<br>from education<br>for the rest of their lives<br>in the years since<br>student achievement has plummeted at the school<br>formerly known as parkview<br>for more than 70% passing to in recent years<br>from the low 40 to mid 50% range<br>so that’s the story<br>the here told us that first meeting<br>in his makeshift to turn groom<br>that this letter which was never fully investigated<br>that described a plot called operation<br>trojah horse which is never found to have existed<br>inspired all of this<br>the ruining of careers and an education of movement<br>the fairmongering<br>headlines against muslims that continue to this day<br>the government<br>instituting policies that encourages to spy<br>more brazen on each other<br>we’ve been talking with the hair for a couple of hours<br>by this point<br>what time is it<br>I know you need to leave at some point I don’t know<br>I mean I’m I have to go to Friday prayer now<br>so 1:00 on there really<br>I understand it’s a lot to talk so if you wanted to<br>there is a lot to<br>no no I don’t get tired of talking these things really<br>I mean you probably could tell<br>obviously when I talk about that<br>you begin to relive it isn’t it<br>and I have to say that<br>you know it does<br>it does suddenly actually has what has been lost<br>for the children for the community<br>the irreparable damage that has been done<br>for absolutely no reason whatsoever<br>so<br>anyway can I get you guys<br>some tea or something<br>at that event I went to<br>where we all got redirected to the wedding hall<br>one of the speakers a columnist mp to oban put it well<br>he said operation trojan horse<br>has become a social fact in bren<br>even though within<br>weeks of the trojah horse that are hitting the news<br>people acknowledge<br>it was probably a hoax<br>that’s never seemed to matter<br>whether muslims and Birmingham were conspiring or not<br>doesn’t matter<br>the intimation that there were has persevered<br>to the extent<br>that prime minister’s former chief of staff was<br>outraged that some people in a community center<br>would dare to say otherwise<br>but we don’t need to settle for social fact<br>because there are actual facts<br>why up to this point<br>has no one cared about who wrote this letter<br>and where this letter came from<br>well that’s my question<br>this is what I’ve been arguing<br>this is why I went to<br>the police to see what they could do<br>this is what I<br>said wrote in my letter to the Birmingham city council<br>that you need to get to the bottom of<br>who wrote the letter<br>this is what I wrote<br>to the department education as well<br>you need to get to the bottom of the letter<br>who wrote the letter because that will then unravel<br>why the letter was written<br>you see so this is what I have been arguing<br>but department education is not interested<br>the police are not interested<br>the Birmingham city council is<br>not interested in answering that question why<br>because they have used this letter<br>and on this hoax they have built so much policy<br>do you think now they want to launch an investigation<br>into the letter to have it proven<br>that it was written for completely<br>different reasons<br>yeah<br>how would that make them look like a bunch of monkeys<br>as I’ve been saying<br>if you could just find out who wrote that letter<br>and why that’s the only thing that might change brain’s<br>understanding<br>of operation trojan horse<br>but whoever wrote the letter<br>they knew me I think<br>and I like to think that I know them too<br>does that mean you<br>I have a strong punchester who wrote the letter<br>you know<br>I strongly believe that I know who wrote the letter<br>and I strongly believe that<br>I know the why what the letter was written as well<br>so you think you know the who and the motive yes<br>that’s next on the trojan horse
