things i take it no i was just do it<br>just fire it up you got it on your string yes<br>recording<br>ladies and gentlemen we’re here<br>are we here<br>see if this fuck<br>i see it ma’am<br>i can hear the sound yeah i really pick up this the sound works<br>what’s it on right now<br>lazy gem<br>we are not a smooth operation<br>this is my friend thompsgura fairly flying talented comedian<br>with drinking coffee we just ate some disgusting food<br>i had a big fed italian sub that’s terrible for you<br>but it tastes good shit<br>a too fast when we knew we had to do this<br>so we got lunch and then we came down and<br>you don’t want to hear about our fucking food<br>you don’t care<br>oh i’m echoing<br>turn my volume down like i said<br>we in a smooth operation<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>what’s going on freaks<br>how the fuck are you all out there<br>you stream land<br>times a girl would you do this weekend<br>what do i do<br>times grew a hilarious stand up kiridion<br>if you haven’t seen him before<br>tom and i met when<br>i was first doing the<br>maxim tour with charlie murphy and john heffron<br>we did this tour<br>and everywhere we had a different guy open up for us<br>and<br>you know<br>most of them were guys that were just starting out<br>or guys that hadn’t been doing it that long<br>it was like a cool little thing for them to get up and<br>do some stand up<br>or it was like the local funny guy there’s like<br>in a couple times like chicago<br>there was like some local guys that went out there were really<br>funny a couple of the places but<br>tom was the funniest<br>at all of them<br>he was the funniest when we were in phoenix and he went up<br>he’s fucking hilarious i was like god damn this dude is really<br>funny like this is some funny shit it was like<br>it was mean spirited but smart and<br>very good stuff man<br>and so we’ve been pals thanks man ever since<br>tom sagura very talented comedian<br>just you know for comedians<br>there’s a lot of comedians that are really funny<br>but you don’t know who they are<br>and it’s a weird thing<br>it’s like to be really good as a comedian is almost like<br>sometimes it’s like the exact opposite mindset to be good at<br>promoting yourself you know<br>don’t you think yeah<br>man there’s like the two extremes<br>exist right yeah<br>the guy there’s some guys<br>i don’t know i just<br>i don’t feel like i feel like you’re supposed to be<br>not just focusing on your stand up<br>but on how to be a great marketing guy yeah<br>it’s hard to do it’s not my mindset you know<br>and there’s guys that are<br>like dan cooks the master at it for sure yeah<br>but there’s guys that are pretty goddamn good at it you know<br>that really<br>really<br>are good about<br>promoting themselves and some of them have a great five minutes<br>but god damn they can fill up places<br>you know it’s an art in and of itself it really is<br>it’s definitely something to be respected<br>you know i’m always amazed when i find out like<br>certain guys are like selling<br>you know ten thousand seed places and you’re like whoa<br>really holy shit how do i do that<br>that’s incredible ten thousand people come to see you cool<br>but is that kenepiary result of doing a<br>great promoting you think well yeah<br>it’s definitely a result of great you have to have something<br>there has to be a product and there has to be great promoting<br>but i think the very same mindset that makes you<br>like the really the<br>really good comics like<br>guys like david tell<br>they’re not the best at promoting themselves you know<br>like these are louis c k<br>i mean louis c k is a great<br>professional comic a great writer but like<br>he just deleted his myspace and deleted his facebook<br>and they want to deal with anymore so<br>he’ll still use twitter<br>just because he felt like it was too much and<br>it’s like it’s almost like<br>to be great creatively it’s almost like you can’t really<br>you know it’s something<br>it’s almost like they don’t they don’t work together<br>like you have to re learn it as a comic<br>like i think you have<br>to like accept that this is a part of the job<br>i mean you can’t think of it it like<br>you know like something you don’t you know you do<br>or you don’t do<br>it’s no big deal you have to think of it this is like<br>an integral part of your job yeah<br>and it’s hard to but it’s the thing is like it’s hard to<br>picture<br>like richard prior being like you gotta come to michael and<br>tell your friends<br>you know you don’t picture him<br>like you just know<br>like you when you get into combo you don’t like think oh<br>and then i’ll<br>recruit people that come to the show you just go<br>i’ll just work i’ll just try to do this well<br>and i’ll never actually never even occurs do you think about it<br>because before you know<br>you think that every<br>like club manager is just like<br>what i do is i make people come here right<br>right right<br>like you’re part of the equation too<br>and it’s a weird thing because now<br>like with the internet like you have more access to people<br>than ever before<br>but it seems like<br>less and less comedians are like popping up than ever before<br>too that’s kind of weird<br>you would think that with<br>the internet there’d be more new comics that you hear about<br>how often you hear about some<br>guy that someone tells you about it’s really funny<br>and you go to see his clips and they’re really<br>funny it’s not that often right<br>you know it’s like<br>think about how many good movies come out of here<br>i think about like how many you know tv shows are excited about<br>and then think about how many comics that you see<br>you know<br>it’s such a weird path<br>you know it’s like no one ever<br>no one who’s smarter and more<br>more balanced than a comedian<br>ever step back<br>and like looked at the whole process and said listen<br>you know this is<br>this is how it should all be done this is how you should go from<br>you know doing open<br>mike nights to being a professional<br>to you know to plotting out your career no<br>no one ever does not<br>and that this i got no one does<br>but this is fat that you’re making me think of something<br>i have to ask you<br>do you think that<br>that<br>i’m thinking about like who’s regarded as like great<br>i’m like how there’s not really<br>you don’t hear about that many new things<br>coming up<br>as far as comics go<br>do you think there is an age<br>that somebody like you have to be<br>to really be<br>like considered super funny like i’m saying a stand up<br>is there a cut off age like<br>because really<br>like gray comics don’t exist<br>under a certain age do you think um<br>yeah i would never say absolutely<br>because i think that if there can be prodigies and music<br>and there can be people that are born with the right<br>neurofrequency to make them like<br>mathematical geniuses when the children and chest geniuses<br>i think all that shit is<br>that’s possible that someone could be like that with comedy too<br>there could be some smartass kid<br>who’s like eighteen years old is funnier than everybody else<br>and just yeah just a bud genius you listen memoring things<br>though too like just having<br>you know such a huge memory yes<br>there’s a certain amount of<br>most certainly a certain amount of what comedy is is<br>the more experiences you have the more<br>information you can draw from<br>and so when you’re older<br>your comedy makes more sense it’s more<br>it’s more complex cause you’re more complex<br>you’ve looked at the puzzle a little bit longer<br>than the young kids but<br>some of the best comedy is not<br>like that some of the best comedy is silly<br>you know like look at brian regan’s comedy<br>that’s some silly shit man but it’s hilarious<br>he’s like brian rig is like one of the only dudes<br>that figured out a way to be hilarious for everybody<br>he’s hilarious like<br>if you don’t think that guy’s funny like you’re being<br>you know you’re not in a good mood you know<br>like he’s saying much<br>fucking silly shit and it’s like really well delivered<br>but you could take your grandmother to go see brian reagan<br>totally<br>and i kid you could think it’s amazing he figured something out<br>well<br>it’s just him though you know i’m saying like that’s who he is<br>and if you’re some kid<br>just some super genius twenty year old kid<br>who’s to say that<br>you can’t be hilarious who’s to say you can’t be like a real<br>you know headliner that i would pay for<br>i mean i look back<br>and like when i was twenty one doing stand up<br>i would like to go back to all those people<br>and give them their money back<br>i would like to go out i am so sorry<br>you had to sit through all that shit<br>you know i would love to go back to people<br>that saw me when i was like twenty two<br>and apologized<br>i am so sorry but you helped me so much i know it was atrocious<br>to get through<br>they’re paying for you to go through college kind of you’re that<br>exactly<br>if you’re a paid comedian and you really have only<br>been doing it for like two years and<br>you’re twenty two years old<br>god damn your material is gonna be dog shit<br>you know i mean i had some stuff actually<br>by the second year i had some stuff<br>that was<br>pretty good it’s like good blow job jokes and stuff like that<br>ones that i could still throw out today if i’m in a hole<br>at one thirty five in the morning<br>you know<br>i need a bit to<br>settle into what we’re talking about<br>yeah<br>it’s possible though right i think<br>some young kid could be amazing<br>i choked fucked up bro<br>yeah i guess it’s possible it’s like<br>do you how often do you find yourself stopping to watch<br>like a twenty five year old<br>or something<br>if it is a twenty five year old it’s a black one<br>you know if someone tells me<br>there’s some white kid that’s in here<br>i’m like how was he twenty five<br>has he done heroin<br>you know see that’s what<br>i’m saying i want to see something that interesting yeah<br>you gotta tell me what happened to him<br>was he kidnapped molested<br>did he graduate harvard early<br>yes yes to all these okay<br>all right let’s see what you have to stay<br>how much<br>of your early stuff you thought was good though like yeah<br>when you hit twenty minutes you’re like<br>i’ve got a great twenty minutes there was<br>a point in time where i was way ahead of myself<br>i thought it was much better than i was<br>and there’s also a point when you realize<br>that a lot of what you’re doing<br>especially<br>with me i realized a lot of what i was doing was just<br>doing tricks i<br>had not relaxed enough to let out my own sense of humor<br>all i was doing was like trying to calculate<br>how to trick them into laughing<br>i hadn’t really figured out what was funny<br>i was coming from a real weird place<br>i was coming from a place of<br>what’s the matter<br>way up yep<br>did you tweet it as me too yeah<br>what is it you put it on twitter it’s on your flare right in<br>okay so we’re on right now yeah on right now<br>okay<br>hmm<br>ladies and gentlemen obviously the new world order does not<br>want us talking about stand up comedy<br>it’s a very dangerous subject<br>and the information that we have leaked in this broadcast<br>this confidential information<br>may be bad for america we’re back<br>i don’t know what the fuck happened we got forced off<br>forced off the air you know<br>because we’re given out secret information about the government<br>government came through<br>they called<br>tommy what’s your take on conspiracies<br>any crazy conspiracies that you believe in<br>is there anything<br>you believe in the people go what the fuck is wrong with you<br>tommy yeah like i’ll be like<br>money makes you happy wow<br>what a bunch of bullshit that is<br>i’m<br>i’m not rich and i’m fucking<br>the happiest guy you’ll ever meet in your life<br>it’s a very happy guy yeah but i think<br>you know george carlin<br>did an interview<br>where he was talking about the key to happiness is<br>find something that you love to do<br>do it well<br>and have people recognize it for it you know and<br>it was a pretty interesting interview<br>because it was dead on the money<br>you know<br>i mean that’s that is really like the key to happiness like<br>even if you<br>even if you’re making really good money<br>doing something you don’t like to do it’s not fun<br>you know i mean<br>even if you’re making great money like as<br>a stockbroker or banker<br>that shit eats away at your fucking soul<br>nobody wants to be doing that<br>you can never be thrilled to do that<br>yeah yeah no there’s like there<br>i mean there are serial killers who really<br>enjoy doing that you know i’m not supposedly right yeah so<br>but who knows what the fuck that is but you know it’s like<br>to really be happy you know<br>the real problem is<br>not everyone can fucking do what they want to do<br>we’d have a whole world full of air force fighter<br>jet pilots martial arts fighters<br>comedians<br>and you know and billionaires and you know what i’m saying yeah<br>there’s gonna have to be regular folks too<br>is going to have to be people that abandon those ideas or<br>families more important than them<br>or some are incapable either yeah<br>there’s good that too<br>but that’s the thing that people don’t want to<br>look at like<br>is if there’s like real inherent potential in people<br>everyone wants to think that everybody’s equal<br>but there’s not true<br>i’m very dumb when it comes to math<br>like my brain it’s like never i never pay attention<br>in high school<br>and when people start talking math<br>i have like a block my brain just glosses the same way yeah<br>if you know i think part of it’s even self imposed right like<br>we’re not as bad at math as we think we are<br>but because<br>the whole everything that we think of with math is scary we just<br>you actually try less in math because<br>you’re already scared of it you know i mean like yeah yes<br>i tell you every level of math yeah me too<br>and you know what the funny thing is almost everybody i know<br>that’s a really good comic because the same problem<br>bad matthew yeah<br>i don’t know any comics like math geniuses<br>it’s like a different mindset you know<br>yeah<br>yeah i think it is that’s just guessing though you know<br>because my friend i had a friend<br>my friend johnny b was a pool player<br>that guy easily could have been a stand up comedian<br>he just nobody talked to him<br>you know there’s a bunch of guys that i’ve met in my life<br>that could have really<br>eddie bravo<br>eddie bravo could have easily been a stand up comedian<br>there’s a bunch of dudes that are just<br>real good storytellers<br>they just know how to make everybody laugh<br>and all they were<br>missing was someone talking them into going on stage yeah<br>there’s so many guys like that<br>but that guy was a mathematical genius<br>and he<br>was a pool player like a professional hustler<br>and he was he was so good at math you could like<br>just yell numbers out<br>like yell three nine two minus five divided by four<br>times a hundred you go two two<br>two twenty six we just<br>have the number<br>that really freaks me out<br>it was crazy he could do it he could do with everything<br>we would sit there<br>with a calculator and we would fuck with them<br>and he was<br>i mean that’s one of the reasons why i so good at pool he was<br>he was amazing<br>at judging angles like he could see it geometrically<br>he would see a pool table<br>he would see the paths you know<br>and that’s another mathematical thing<br>are a lot of good pool players good<br>met there’s a bunch of guys who are kitchens yeah<br>the guys who have like a real natural talent for it like<br>as good as i ever play pool when i was playing pool<br>like eight ten hours a day<br>i was always never near as good as like a really good guys<br>and my friend johnny was like as good as like when he was on<br>he could play as good as anybody have ever seen really yeah<br>it’s a talent you know<br>there’s a certain amount of it is hard work and dedication<br>but there’s a certain there’s<br>every now and then whether it’s in music or in you know<br>in you know sports every now and then there’s hard work<br>comes along and<br>runs into a talent<br>you know when you see someone who’s got something<br>just some<br>natural incredible gift and on top of that they work<br>hard with it you know<br>that’s that’s like the type of shit that’s the real<br>amazing thing yeah<br>somebody is that talented and they’re still working really hard<br>yeah like fighters like bjpen is a perfect example<br>that here’s a guy who was super hyper talented<br>but his big problem was<br>he’d ever really trained like the most obsessed guys<br>do i mean he trained hard<br>no doubt about it but there’s a certain level of fitness<br>these fucking crazy monsters<br>these george ap errors<br>these savages they’re on this insanely high level of fitness<br>and you know and finally<br>bj is training just like those guys are now so now<br>it’s incredible<br>and you see guy with<br>talent and on top of the talent now you have dedication<br>according to it it’s amazing too if you look at like<br>of all sports and others at least a couple guys in every sport<br>that some of them<br>were known for not working hard yeah<br>but they were so yeah like someone<br>i think tell me what everybody knows guys like pete sampers<br>and everybody knows pete sampras<br>mm hmm like apparently i think it’s him like<br>if it’s not i’m sorry but i think it’s pete<br>that<br>like they said like didn’t really train<br>and the guy had like every<br>grand slam tied that’s incredible he was basically unbeatable<br>for a stretch of years<br>he married a chick that i did a pilot for a tv show with<br>i wish i could remember her name she was super cool<br>she was an adam sandra<br>bridget wilson i think this was up no<br>i thought deck i can’t remember her name she was very nice<br>though yeah<br>that guy was a super tennis player and he didn’t train<br>i think they said that like<br>it’s not that he didn’t train it’s just like<br>not a hard work<br>isn’t it funny like that<br>black women have made his tenants with the william sisters<br>when we guys see like yolked up running back<br>looking tennis players you know<br>dudes like herschel walker type tennis player who just for bam<br>just fuck that ball up<br>you know i mean like those guys are coming<br>i mean all they have to do is like get into tennis and<br>all these white guys are fucked<br>you know i mean that’s just that’s just how it’s gonna go down<br>if eddie if ever there’s like<br>a path for inner city school kids to get good to tennis oh<br>the only reason tennis is a rich person sport man<br>who the fuck is playing tennis<br>where is the tennis court right<br>you know if you go<br>to tennis court<br>in the bad neighborhood that’s where people fight<br>you know i mean it’s not you know<br>you get black kids really into tennis holy shit it’s over<br>it’s over it’s a rap it’s a rap<br>what are you gonna move faster than them<br>you know what<br>i wonder why it hasn’t happened for real though i don’t<br>know it’s funny for somehow another<br>that’s perceived as being racist<br>but when you talk about black athletes<br>like the black athletes are some of the best in all sports<br>there’s great white athletes there’s greatly george cp air<br>and you know broccolizer<br>there’s freak athletes athletes are white too<br>but man there’s a lot of great black ones holy shit<br>bobby buckeye says when venus and serena have kids god<br>venus and serena what kind of imagine<br>if venus and serena had kids with bobby lashley<br>you know bobby lashley is<br>he’s just super yolked up wrestler dude who<br>is fighting mixed martial arts now<br>he looks like<br>looks like like<br>a like one of those little<br>he man action figures doesn’t even like a real human<br>he’s just fucking super yolked<br>and smashing dudes just<br>picking him up slamming them in their backs he’s<br>super powerful wrestler<br>him and serena williams oh my god<br>i think it’s even crazier when people say it’s like<br>that blacks aren’t great athletes yeah that would be<br>that’s well this guy<br>i have a little twitter conversation back and forth this dude<br>last night he said that me and goldberg<br>ovaries refer to black people as explosive and athletic<br>when they’re describing a black fighter<br>and that you know that could be perceived as racist<br>because you’re not<br>counting into fact that they’re very technical<br>as well<br>that’s bullshit you know<br>we always count<br>into effect<br>whether a guys are technical like when you look at a guy like<br>phil davis is this wrestler just fought in the last cfc<br>wasn’t just explosive than athletic he’s like a high level<br>wrestler you know<br>his technique was outstanding and the way he took these guys<br>down was like almost effortless<br>you know he’s so good at wrestling<br>and the guy i fought this guy brian stan<br>had a good take down defense but this dude is so<br>all around so good<br>how could you not say he’s explosive and that’s like<br>that’s ridiculous that is exactly what he is and they want you<br>it’s not that he’s not technical too but<br>come on man that guy has some freak gifts<br>his legs are like fucking ten feet long<br>they look like like<br>almost like an antelope’s legs<br>you know i’m saying like he looks like he could<br>when he was out there<br>standing in front of the dude<br>i’m like he looks like he could jump over him<br>he looks so powerful<br>you know and like brock lesters another one<br>that’s a perfect example of a white guy<br>how can you not say<br>that guy is like athletic how can you not say he’s explosive<br>he’s and he’s white and he’s just a fucking giant<br>viking dude you know<br>he’s got viking genetics or some shit in him you know<br>i’m saying he’s an animal fuck yeah<br>i mean that’s just that’s just real<br>like that’s like<br>the most savage that america’s capable of producing<br>that’s if you’re american<br>power genetic right there you know i’m saying like you get<br>a lot of like especially like<br>with slavery in america i mean so many<br>i mean it’s like<br>something that you’re not supposed to talk<br>about for whatever reason<br>but it’s a known fact<br>that slaves would breed<br>the biggest males of the biggest females<br>and i mean how many<br>african americans in this country come from slavery like<br>god damn<br>it’s a real it’s a real obvious thing that’s the reason<br>why there’s so many<br>really powerful strong ones it’s almost like genetic engineer<br>it’s absurd to not recognize<br>that there are more<br>explosive athletic but that’s a good<br>thing like how could that possibly be<br>but how could that possibly be like<br>negative like you’re in some ways<br>people are saying like well<br>you’re making excuses for them you’re saying<br>they’re better than people because<br>of that and it’s not because of technique but that’s just you<br>you’re putting that in your own head<br>i would never say that<br>you know and there are guys that are explosive that aren’t that<br>technical but you know<br>that’s just because<br>that’s how they are and there’s guys that are you know<br>it’s like you gotta be honest about<br>when it comes to sports and anything like<br>everyone’s so touchy feely with this whole black white issue<br>you know we’re all human beings folks but it’s it’s very obvious<br>that chinese guys don’t have bigger dicks than black guys<br>i mean everybody fucking knows it<br>you couldn’t argue it in court yeah you know<br>if you<br>if you pulled out all the black dicks and all the chinese dicks<br>it would be a simple i would bet every fucking dollar i have<br>that the black guys would win right<br>they would be<br>the white the chinese dicks would be crying every now<br>and then you think<br>you got a big dick<br>until you tune into u porn<br>and there’s some dude<br>and i’m not talking fake rubber dicks brian<br>i know what you thinking<br>i’m talking real dicks<br>there’s dudes with real dicks that look like fucking arms<br>like mandingo yeah<br>they’re real dicks<br>they aren’t holding on to it<br>it’s not strapped on their balls are shaved<br>this is his real giant dick and he’s fucking the shit that is<br>poor little white runaway<br>and this girl with a bad tattoo in her ass and<br>that’s intimidating from mandingo’s dick actually looks like<br>a weapon that he could use like in a fight or like<br>to get you like<br>give him money like<br>that guy’s dead it looks like it<br>looks like a fist have you seen lexington steel oh yeah<br>this is joked up black dude<br>you guys got a dick like fourteen inches wrong i just did<br>we’re talking reality here people<br>do you see what’s taken over twitter<br>the new thing no<br>i was just gonna<br>talk about john holmes’s dick though it’s very important<br>the last big white guy with a big dick was<br>john holmes known for his big dick<br>who else has been known for<br>a big giant not like pretty much yeah<br>it’s not the same<br>he’s got a big dick<br>but it’s not ridiculous john holmes was a monster<br>it was a snake<br>but the dude could never get fully hard right<br>it was always like cause all<br>it was all jacked up on whatever<br>the fuck he was doing at the time<br>jeremy that movie that where val killer played him<br>pretty interesting little bit yeah the guy was a mess<br>but it was never like a<br>never like a weapon you know yeah<br>i know these things look whatever<br>look black guys<br>you can run faster and jump higher<br>and you have bigger scarier dicks<br>that’s a fact i mean it’s<br>to say it to act like it’s not true<br>and those dicks are terrifying<br>it’s a stereotype tom stereotype yeah<br>you shouldn’t support those stereotypes because there’s a lot of<br>black eyes out there with little dicks<br>and they don’t want to<br>get along with their woman<br>pull it out<br>and have all these higher sure it’s just not the color<br>like if it was the same black eye would be white<br>would it just be that creepy river dick<br>it wouldn’t even be big it would just be a creepy river dick<br>creepy river what river<br>what crazy talk what is that<br>i don’t know i’ve never heard they got too high<br>i’m gonna have to show this camera off<br>the settings here did you see the new thing<br>that it’s taking over twitter<br>no the google buzz have you been kind of a tester of that yet<br>no what is that it’s pretty much google’s taking twitter<br>and embedding it into gmail jesus fucking christ savages yeah<br>i just started oh my god<br>it never ends it’s gonna take over twitter god damn it<br>i was hoping that twitter would be it<br>i would hope i would hope we could stop but you know what<br>here’s the thing man google’s taken over the universe<br>they’re they’re they’re<br>gonna be internet service providers now<br>google’s gonna<br>install their own pipes and neighborhoods<br>these gigantic fucking<br>one gigabyte pipes these fiber optics that like get you<br>you can download porn on the moon<br>and like you know fractions of a second<br>they’re doing some nutty shit man they own everything<br>man google maps<br>google voicemail google male google everything<br>it takes over it’s crazy the takeovers begun<br>could you imagine if we<br>find out one day that what google was was<br>everybody was saying well<br>if there is artificial intelligence<br>you know<br>when artificial intelligence eventually manifests itself like<br>will it even let itself be known<br>or will people just go about their lives not<br>knowing that artificial intelligence is alive and conscious<br>and while our artificial intelligence is trying to plot<br>what to do and how to take over the situation<br>well if computers were intelligent<br>wouldn’t they start up<br>a company that would just buy up everything<br>and own own you<br>have your accounts where you do<br>your you can do<br>google purchases we buy things with<br>a google account and you got google male<br>google maps shows where you fucking live<br>you know you got google everything<br>in your google voicemail<br>it’s documenting everything that you say it’s making like little<br>little<br>transcriptions of every voicemail that gets left on you what do<br>you hear that<br>google is going to try to do their maps<br>but inside of buildings that’s for next thing<br>so like if you’re like<br>i want to know where that pot store is oh<br>there it is i want to see what it looks like inside<br>and you just walk through the store and they just announced<br>a couple days ago that<br>they have all these ski<br>thing so now you can go<br>down ski mountains<br>on google maps it’s already on google mounts right now gt gt yes<br>you can go to any google<br>was really artificial intelligence<br>slowly consuming society<br>well the people<br>at the very top like no one’s met the boss you know it’s had<br>like the boss is fucking<br>pay no attention to the man behind the curtain you know<br>it’s a fucking computer man<br>could you imagine<br>this is the bad guy from inspector gadget with a cat like<br>how does it work<br>what would you think would happen<br>if there was a moment where artificial intelligence<br>became independent<br>they were able<br>to operate and sustain themselves without any human<br>action they had a<br>system setup of checks and balances<br>where they could always make sure that they would stay awake<br>they would always make sure the power was on<br>they had robusts that they were controlling that could<br>manipulate everything and do what they wanted them to do<br>at that point time will when do we find out<br>how because that’s gonna happen right i mean<br>if it’s possible already happen<br>it’s gonna happen<br>if it hasn’t happened if<br>you know with moore’s lawn with you know<br>the exponential increase in you know accelerating increase in<br>complexity when it comes to technology<br>it’s gonna it’s not gonna stop right here it’s gonna keep going<br>it’s gonna keep going in the same direction<br>that’s going right now<br>will we be enslaved at that point though oh<br>don’t do that to my cat<br>she gets she freaks out when people like like<br>do weird shit with her like holder in front of things<br>and she’ll go pee somewhere<br>all right right right they can’t do that right<br>she loves attention but<br>if you fuck with her she’ll shit in your bag<br>she loves me<br>do you think that like<br>it’ll be well<br>we all be google slaves of<br>i’m wondering on the man<br>google’s gonna take over the goddamn universe<br>how do you use by the way have you used the other<br>search engines google is skynet why don’t they just change it<br>i’ve been actually trying to use bingles is it is it good<br>it’s alright it’s better than yahoo i mean who or who is yeah<br>what happened<br>how did google just become such<br>uber cyber pimps they had the basic color<br>graphic and that’s all it was<br>remember when you first went to you yeah<br>but that’s not why<br>they’re so successful why are they so successful<br>in hitting<br>all these major marvels it’s like they made a brand name<br>and then once they made that brand name<br>all the other<br>versions of what they do were diminished significantly like<br>i don’t know what the numbers are<br>it’s like yahoo searches to google searches<br>but everybody i talk to when you have a question<br>you go google that shit yeah you know hey<br>why is this guy red on certain nights when the sunsets<br>let’s google that shit bam<br>you know what is that<br>oh well<br>that’s the moisture in the air combined with you know the<br>fucking<br>rotation of the earth and you’re only getting the corona whoa<br>whoa whoa<br>that’s fascinating shit man<br>we didn’t have that weird kids we were just stupid<br>this is a fantastic time to be alive that’s great<br>you can ask any question that thing right until google<br>fuck system the ass<br>right until google shuts the whole system down takes over<br>i just really want the next big thing to be<br>everything you see is recorded<br>tight thing what<br>why do you want that brian<br>you’re freaked out there so many times where i’m just like<br>like i walked out the other night<br>and i saw a shooting star<br>and it was the biggest shooting star i ever saw<br>and i’m just like<br>fuck i wish i saw that<br>i could just show that to somebody else right<br>but then you would rewind it<br>and it would get to the part where you were beaten off<br>early that day<br>sorry i went too far<br>and you had two fingers up your butthole and you’re making<br>scissor motions of your figures and you’re beating it<br>i have my force to see that too<br>you think it’s going to be something<br>like where you’re going to put like these<br>contact lenses in<br>that are like<br>a computer or something that goes over your eyes<br>there’s going to be some sort of a neural interface<br>there’s going to be something<br>that connects people’s minds and the whole system of<br>recording and consciousness in your mind and connects that<br>directly to a computer<br>that’s what’s going to happen it’s<br>going to be you’re going to have a way to access<br>other databases and this is what<br>i think it’s probably<br>going to be it’s probably<br>going to be they’re going to come up with an artificial brain<br>they’re going to reproduce the human brain<br>and i mean once they get to the point<br>where they can do that once they get to the point<br>where they can<br>they can literally create or recreate a human mind<br>and and have all its functions mapped out and do it correctly<br>like that<br>that seems like nonsense but that shit’s just a matter of time<br>they’re going to be able to do that eventually<br>and when they do god damn<br>they will have<br>finally something<br>though that we’ve always wanted like flying cars for then<br>it’ll be crazier than that<br>it’ll be one they have an artificial brain<br>and they know exactly how the brain works<br>they know exactly how to interface with your brain<br>they mean it might be possible to interface with your brain<br>with a frequency that you could transmit through the air well<br>people have to do anything at that point<br>it might be like wi fi man<br>you might not have to do anything<br>like biologically to your brain<br>what i’m saying is they might figure out a way to tap<br>into the very fucking frequency that your brain operates under<br>you got mad ants it sounds like<br>what’s cause you need dirty bitch they hate you<br>i’m gonna kick your ass i do have ants i got ant problem<br>they’re like all over it it’s carpet yeah well<br>nobody gives a fuck about that out there in<br>eastern land pro it’s not fascinating<br>it’s gonna talk about ants for a while<br>so you know what is gonna happen that’s the big question<br>what the fuck is it gonna be what is what is gonna be this<br>this big change<br>that takes us from where we are today<br>i think it’s gonna be something<br>like that i think the next big jump is gonna be something<br>where we can directly access information<br>you know<br>like you know they maybe they can even try it in a town<br>you know and one town will volunteer for it<br>and the whole fucking town becomes telepathic<br>you know<br>like they have this frequency they can broadcast it like<br>like a wi fi type signal<br>and the wi fi type type signal is hooked to some sort of<br>some sort of a machine or something<br>that can take brainways and connect them and<br>what’s the word i’m looking for translate them<br>into binary code<br>into ones and zeros into the information from the internet<br>and then it can transmit it right back into brain waves<br>so you could access things<br>without doing anything<br>without having any chips in your brain<br>without having any wires if<br>they could get to the point<br>where they could figure out how to transmit something<br>that your brain could automatically and instantly produce<br>i think google goggles is a pretty good step to<br>being able to take a picture of anything<br>and it’s like google search for photos right<br>you could just walk around back what’s this bird right<br>brings you up everything about that bird right<br>i think that’s gonna be good too because<br>you have to have like competing companies doing all that shit<br>though right yeah<br>happy that we all get it from one sword right<br>that’s a problem yeah<br>google has a good reputation though right<br>i don’t know i think isn’t it but<br>it also is a really aggressive like company yeah well<br>obviously shit they’re taking over the goddamn war yeah exactly<br>i used to really like google<br>but now i’m getting kind of freaked out by him later really<br>it’s just about<br>the information that they have to growing in power you know tan<br>tan tan<br>i mean we’re pretty much trusting a website with a lot<br>of information<br>a lot almost everything<br>yeah yeah i mean they know where you live bro<br>they got a map of your fucking house<br>it’s really weird right<br>i have a phone in my pocket that has<br>me gps everywhere i am in the whole entire world<br>maybe google maybe google step one<br>and then you know<br>step two is you have to buy the certain cell phone<br>stick it up your ass and go back in time<br>it is the goddamned armination<br>i don’t even excited to watch loss i got that shit dvr<br>i’m not even excited to watch it<br>it wasn’t a good episode last week board the shit out of me man<br>last week it was like<br>we’re going back in time<br>oh and then the bomb and here we go oh look<br>they’re this crazy they’re in this time<br>but are they in that time or this time where are they right<br>this guy nick yusek said it fast the last episode the last<br>ninety seconds is all they needed for the whole episode<br>you know it seems to be like<br>i didn’t it was a brilliant show that is impossible to keep up<br>you know it’s impossible to keep people strung<br>along and fascinated for some of the years do you<br>but the same people are riding<br>at certain point time you don’t think the wells dry<br>no i thought it was dry like maybe the third season well<br>maybe they’re just setting a bunch of things up<br>and it’ll be worth it<br>in the future<br>i watched the whole first<br>three seasons whatever the hell it was<br>i watched them all on dvd so i watched them all in a row<br>which is awesome<br>no commercials<br>you watch two three in a row it’s fun that was great yeah<br>were you hooked for the first time you saw it<br>i actually caught up like he did<br>but i started like at season two<br>i just went author one<br>into i get hooked on shows man then i get bored like i<br>bounced our galactica i loved that show<br>that show was incredible<br>i couldn’t get in on that till the last season<br>the last season i was like oh<br>okay anymore you know it wasn’t that it was it was bad<br>it was just after a while it’s like los angeles<br>did i didn’t have enough invested in it<br>it’s like you’re if you’re building a show towards<br>a certain conclusion<br>you know and then they have a new conclusion all<br>send them around a planet<br>okay well<br>how’s this gonna work out after a while you just lose interest<br>yeah it’s like you’ve been dragged<br>the drama’s been dragged out of you<br>you know a series i think<br>it’s very difficult when there’s a quest<br>you know when there’s a quest to find like the new earth<br>you know it’s good to motivate you through a few episodes but<br>to keep that going like as a series and<br>stay interested i think that’s hard to do<br>i think there’s kind of something like<br>even though you’re not getting as much<br>there’s something great about<br>those series that make like a short season<br>like some of the hbo<br>ones you know<br>they don’t do like a twenty two episode thing right<br>and they can keep you if their season is<br>six twelve episodes<br>you can stay much more hooked<br>what they’re doing and it raises the quality of those<br>yeah you know but when you watch like a<br>a series<br>you know if you’re watching<br>like they have twenty two episode seasons<br>or sometimes more than that<br>like forty episode season yeah<br>for some shows<br>it’s hard to keep that compelling forty who has forty<br>i don’t know it’s half park maybe actually<br>yeah but like you know like when you watch did you watch<br>like the original<br>miss nine drama obviously but the original<br>office on hpo look for six episodes i never watched it<br>you watch what’s good i haven’t watched anyone he is fantastic<br>it’s really hard for me for whatever reason<br>to watch comedies like what especially when i’m on my own<br>like i’m watching with friends or you know<br>i don’t like sit down by myself and like when i watched a movie<br>they’re always almost<br>always monster movies<br>i’m always watching like<br>some werewolf movie or some even shitty ones<br>like i watched steven king’s nightflyer<br>the other night it’s a terrible vampire movie but i like it<br>it’s fun stupid yeah<br>i don’t watch comedies by myself that one was<br>given to me if i’m alone i’m watching documentaries or you know<br>or see it like that if i’m gonna watch something fiction<br>i want it to be completely stupid<br>i’ve given up on like you know<br>rt like you told me about the hurt locker yeah<br>yeah i could watch it no<br>no i keep like thinking about watching them like<br>don’t i mean no actually<br>do<br>just because i would like to see what you think about it i just<br>can’t believe<br>all these people are praising it the more movies freaking<br>it’s alright but it’s just like<br>people love it man<br>some people love it<br>people though that i saw pressure save the day yeah<br>i wasn’t it’s chicks hot right<br>she’s super hot<br>she’s super hot<br>she can wrestle and take some flag she’s<br>it’s the it’s just like just<br>the movies basically<br>oh this sucks back a lot<br>and then this looks and this sucks<br>and this sucks and then it ends with the worst thing ever<br>and you’re like cool this movie<br>i don’t like that feeling man you know people<br>tell you that you’re not<br>deep because you don’t enjoy being depressed you know<br>you don’t enjoy<br>i don’t want<br>to go somewhere if you’re gonna manipulate my feelings<br>and that’s all you’re really doing i mean are you<br>i guess some movies raise awareness for certain causes<br>and some movies make you think about things a little bit<br>different but i don’t need to be depressed all right<br>if i want to watch a documentary on something<br>i’ll watch it but if you’re gonna make some shit up<br>make it fun for me okay yeah yeah you know<br>i like i like fucking i<br>like vampires<br>i like<br>werewolves and shit i’m looking forward to benicio del toro<br>this weekend the wolfman yeah<br>and i’m looking forward to it i like i like shit that’s fun<br>you don’t have to depress me with child bullet station<br>and abuse and<br>i don’t like that they draw addiction<br>i don’t like the idea that we have to reward<br>something<br>that really does depress you just because it depressed you yeah<br>everyone go like this movie is awesome<br>it’ll depress the shit at you<br>and then when it does you have to go<br>you’re right that was awesome<br>why is that awesome<br>and yeah yeah what is that<br>what is that why are those the better ones<br>how come the ones that make you laugh are like oh<br>that’s no big deal it’s only making you laugh<br>but the ones that make you like feel like shit<br>like i remember i

the<br>stockholders of mad<br>at mr hathuna<br>because mr halfnair apparently is<br>he doesn’t want<br>to sell the company and even though there’s been<br>some a couple of good offers to sell the

rock<br>that was terrible<br>you know this that whole<br>hugh hefner thing is such a weird thing man<br>you know that one<br>one dude figured out a way how to make like pornography<br>acceptable<br>really is i have to<br>show their pussies<br>show everything else don’t show don’t get crazy<br>you know have her bent over and you can see like a little lip<br>but

dude<br>it was just like what it was avatar<br>no it was avatar<br>it wasn’t even her yeah i was like<br>airbrush boob dude it wasn’t even airbrushed it was avatar<br>but why would you pay money for that that’s what<br>i’m saying is why didn’t we pay money<br>why is that business it’s still in business well<br>we were stoned and we were at<br>the hotel and no<br>i’m saying what wood people buy because people are idiots oh<br>we threw a tooth<br>you have to see that table beat down with your toots<br>and they buy it<br>i mean or the articles<br>that’s the other argument is that they have good articles<br>but i don’t know if they have good articles<br>i think that’s a urban myth is it<br>well at one point in time<br>they had good articles i know that<br>because there was a book that i bought<br>a long time ago it was a bunch of interviews with<br>a playboy interviews<br>and it was really fascinating and one of them was sinatra<br>and i never realized sinatra<br>was so fucking smart<br>sinatra was really smart<br>and i found<br>out this from this book of playboy interviews<br>it was pretty fascinating<br>but it was more abrelate about what<br>sinatra had to say than it was about the<br>guy interviewing<br>i remember my first<br>dirty chip was from a playboy magazine in the seventies oh<br>your silly goes<br>what was it<br>why is it<br>why is it girls asshole and pussy so close together<br>so you can pick them up like a six pack<br>oh geez<br>that was in playboys<br>my eighteen seventy eight or smarty grass are ready to clean up<br>that’s painful i just think about fingernails<br>scraping inside of body parts and<br>that’s just rude<br>that shit is rude brian<br>how dare you wait so was terry nut naked in this<br>she was just basically naked<br>and she was like<br>she doesn’t have any<br>ass her ass was holding an expertection program<br>her ass was nowhere to be seen her ass<br>well except for that woman she’s sitting on the table<br>like trying to squish her<br>but to make sure she has an ass but i wasn’t buying it<br>it’s so funny that’s okay eddie bravo showed me that move well<br>that’s a fever’s move<br>when they don’t have an ass you gotta sit on the table yeah<br>we’re talking about that<br>hilarious<br>yeah man i mean it’s like<br>you know a certain point of time<br>you know what are you really showing me<br>that’s not really a picture of someone<br>it’s not really what they look like<br>i see what she looks like that’s not what she looks like<br>why does she look like that scarface<br>is it like a knife is it really not<br>her body in the pose<br>i mean it’s her body but it’s so airbrushed<br>it’s crazy skin isn’t looking down it’s pores it’s not like<br>you know and<br>apparently look she got in shape and she got her act together<br>and that’s why she wanted to do this that’s what i heard<br>i totally understand that but you’re<br>who really wants to see that<br>who really wants to see<br>like fake stuff i would<br>rather see a girl who doesn’t look that hot<br>but she’s real i could see her skin that’s like hotter<br>you know a girl that even that isn’t in that good of shape but<br>she gave that a little roll of fat but you see her real skin<br>you know what i’m saying that’s hot<br>like that airbrush shit is not even a little<br>hot there’s nothing hot to it<br>you can’t you can’t get past the law you’re being told<br>it’s like the lies so great<br>that you looking at it you’re like what am i even<br>seeing i’m not even getting anything<br>from this you know it’s like it’s like fake fire<br>i don’t feel the heat there’s nothing there<br>you know i mean that’s what it’s like<br>it’s just they’re fucking much it<br>really does nothing for you too like when you see that<br>it just<br>loses its effect you know like saying the person<br>and it’s like how can playboys still be in visions also<br>because people look at that<br>and then we’ll see what this looks like<br>see what her photos look like no<br>look at it at the store i’m like ooooo<br>i’m not buying that<br>how hurry people still call you well<br>they have a big piece of plastic<br>around the magazine where you can’t do that<br>it won’t let you look at it<br>because if you look at it no<br>one’s gonna buy it there’s always one issue that’s okay<br>but i know there’s always one asshole like you<br>have you ever done that beyond no<br>i’ve never done that i’ve never done that<br>i think when i was a kid<br>i used to do it to take like a bonus video<br>game that they would put in<br>the<br>game game magazines<br>you know i never<br>i keep telling people<br>that i’m gonna answer their questions on my own form<br>and i never do<br>so i’m gonna go to that right now just to check it out<br>because every now and then so i<br>somebody will have a good question<br>you guys are going australia next week<br>do you like your<br>goat sea<br>flyer i made did you even notice there’s a goat sea on that fire<br>no i’m a crocotile dundee oh is it really<br>it goes<br>down and there’s little goat sea on the pot oh how dare you<br>okay a lot of these questions suck<br>no they don’t suck it’s just<br>a little too stoned would you ever desire to be a porn star<br>drill is why desire to be a porn star<br>steve us says no<br>i don’t want anybody looking at my penis<br>i get very insecure<br>i just i don’t want to think that you’re thinking about you<br>if the money was right would you ever do porn<br>nobody would want to see that<br>i would like to see it i mean i would do something to see<br>i wouldn’t charge you all right that’s a rap<br>ladies and gentlemen thanks<br>we had a good show<br>we gay with each other<br>have you brian<br>there was thought about it at once you know what<br>you thought about it<br>at one point well<br>what’s it like do that<br>yeah i met a lot of gay porn stars<br>i met a lot of dudes<br>i met a lot of dudes who<br>i held you i’ve ever met a gay porn storm when webcams first<br>started becoming big i had sex with this girl in a webcam<br>and this is before<br>like when it was brand new<br>and i had it i remember like forty years<br>what year it looks like a good one it’s like ninety<br>five ninety six<br>that’s what all these rooms were just<br>ninety five something like that ninety five nine<br>six really so it was like fifty six k<br>in you were streaming it wasn’t it was probably<br>faster than fifty six k<br>by then i think it was bribe like first bride man<br>but<br>like i remember having sex in with this girl<br>and i was more just so i could have how many people watched it<br>i think it was like fifty people in it<br>but i remember i was like doing the camera<br>i never thought like anyone would be able to record it<br>you never thought it would have gotten this<br>crazy like what that was back<br>then we had such a feeling of innocence back oh<br>yeah it was so innocent back then well<br>it was i never do it now just think about<br>just the feeling of connection<br>that you have with human beings now just because of twitter<br>just because it’s shit like you stream<br>just because it’s shit like this<br>the connection that we have now is nothing like it was back<br>then<br>it’s really hard to imagine that that was only<br>fourteen years ago it seems like it was like<br>that seems like a long jump in<br>human evolution as far as our culture our technology<br>it’s a pretty big goddamn jump yeah<br>you know<br>i’m this guy doing hever<br>to shit like this you could just do something like this<br>just put it on<br>this little social media site and all these people watch it and<br>people download it later<br>and watch it later yeah it’s incredible it<br>really is fucking nice<br>i still can’t get over that you had a webcam in ninety five<br>this is the original geek man<br>he’s old school<br>bro he’s old school<br>how big was a webcam that it was pretty big<br>it actually was a lie to tech and i think it was like<br>about this about that pig which is a huge tech eye yeah<br>wow<br>yeah dude i had a t one line in my house in ninety eight<br>damn<br>yeah i had to get a t one line installed in my house<br>but i needed fast<br>enough here’s how fat funny<br>they didn’t know<br>about technology when aol first came out with instant messaging<br>where you could type to your friends<br>kind of like text messaging<br>they used to have a guys voice that i’d be like<br>instant message every time you got a message<br>oh hi how’s it going hi nice to see you san and i’m good<br>instant met every single i remember<br>like the first couple months it was okay<br>you know but then i got to the poison<br>it’s it was like no way to turn it off<br>i learned how to type fast from<br>typing in like irc when we’re playing quake and playing<br>quaint quake to learn how to type fast because you know<br>you’re typing like in real time<br>and having our conversations in real time right<br>you know eventually that’s just going<br>to be straight speech to text yeah<br>or just straight speech<br>but the problem is straight speeches<br>and everybody will be talking over about it<br>everybody well<br>that’s not mean like xbox live that’s how<br>it is you sit there with like thirty people<br>and people like mom won’t kill that bitch<br>it’s like it’s great<br>it’s like a party chapline with a bunch of retards<br>that’s how it is<br>you know quake is not like that<br>at least quake<br>maybe the new ones will be like that but they don’t have voice<br>over and i think one of the reasons is because it<br>would eat up more bandwidth<br>and it probably<br>make the game slower does it make the game slower well back<br>then that would think so<br>but nowadays you have twenty megabytes right<br>up your ups ups like two megabytes<br>two one and a half two that’s still way more than yeah but<br>you’d quake every goddamn millisecond of ping county<br>this is geek talk<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>is that a game with one of these riches talking about<br>yeah is that like a lot of people in like well<br>some games are at like thirty people in our room<br>and you can talk to each other yeah<br>yeah well whoever’s on your team right<br>with everybody talks grind you play xbox live<br>i don’t play xbox live<br>i used to have a real problem<br>quick i used to play quake like eight hours of that so<br>i’ve been<br>i played quake<br>i started out quick too but i actually like quick one better<br>but then nobody was playing quick one and then<br>we played quick three with quick three came out that was<br>that was probably<br>the most fun one to play that was the hay day<br>the quick three because quake three was like<br>more complicated graphically look cooler<br>it was a combination of one and two<br>you know those fucking games are so goddamn addictive<br>because you’re playing live<br>you log on if you never play quake before you log on<br>you you know you have all your settings and your<br>computer for like you know your mouse speed<br>and all this jazz get comfortable with it<br>then you log on<br>and you jump into a fucking three dimensional world<br>where you have earphones okay<br>and in these earphones you hear sounds to the right<br>that means someone’s to your right<br>dudes are shooting at you rocket launchers<br>and fucking lightning guns<br>and it’s a dark fucking<br>hallway you’re running down and dudes are hiding<br>and they’re fucking blasting you<br>it’s fun as fuck<br>it’s cell phones i’m so surprised that you’re into that<br>but you’re not<br>into something like modern warfare to oh<br>it’s not that i wouldn’t be into it i would love to do it<br>the problem is i don’t want to get addicted to anything<br>yeah i had a real problem get addicted to quake<br>sure it’s incredible quake something<br>you like even though you get addicted to it yeah<br>you probably get addicted to it it’s so<br>amazing i don’t have any time man<br>i don’t wanna do that i didn’t have time on games was quake<br>it really is a game system or was it yes<br>no it’s a free pc for your pc yeah you<br>you know it’s just<br>you had to have a real good<br>graphics card i don’t want to play it with all<br>the fancy shit on all the lights<br>but you could play it in a decent where it would look decent<br>you know if your computer wasn’t as good<br>but if you had a good computer and a good video card<br>oh my god it’s staggering good high resolution<br>dudes would explode you<br>railgun them and their<br>body explodes in a spray of blood it’s fucking spectacular<br>lightning bolts are flying through the air and<br>the shadows the fucking lightning bolts<br>create shadows and the walls and shits<br>that mad modern warfare too you’re in something<br>that really looks exactly<br>exactly like lax yeah<br>you’re sitting there just fucking plowing people down<br>and there’s that’s crazy i mean<br>you’re fucking at a starbucks there’s just fucking little<br>mugs that you could break and change that would rather be a<br>space station or xbox pc xbox<br>i think it’s everything everything<br>i like about quake is it doesn’t even seem remotely real<br>you know you’re rocket launching you could rocket jump<br>where you take your rocket launcher<br>and you pull it at the ground and jump at the same time<br>you go flying through the air<br>that was my favorite shit to do<br>that was my favorite shit to do to go rocket jump<br>i had rocket jump to fuck i<br>did it was so much fun<br>did you do halo<br>no i played halo for a little bit but again<br>i don’t want to get a dick today i never got<br>too much in a halo it’s alright<br>but modern warfare too is just fucking<br>you can’t beat this guy says call of duty is way too slow<br>that’s what i like about quake<br>it’s so goddamn fast it’s nothing like real physics<br>like when you’re walking down the hallway<br>you know how you’re running<br>if you’re running down a hallway would be like this<br>when quake it’s a<br>you’re flying you sorry cat cat up sorry cat<br>you can fucking run<br>i mean you can fly<br>through the air man dudes are flying and jumping left<br>and writing<br>see to me that’s just like twitch gaming it’s just like yeah<br>the fuck’s going on fucking fun man<br>it’s fun<br>i like it realistic<br>i like it you’re going<br>into this world like you’re going into avatar<br>road and then you’re just you think you’re playing through this<br>lax right<br>and then i come in with my<br>rocket launcher and fuck you write in the ants<br>your game is stupid he jumps<br>a dude from quake<br>there would be no competition if you fought a dude from<br>modern duty call of warfare whatever<br>the fuck you’re watching whatever games these are<br>you can take a quick space marine<br>and have a fight with these dudes<br>the space being take a couple shots bro<br>they have like a hundred and fifty you know life points<br>you can’t just kill them with one bullet<br>and he’s gonna rocket launch you in the fucking head<br>and you’re gonna explode<br>that game is dumb the quite games more fun<br>they’re more durable<br>they have more abilities their weapons are way crazier<br>the physics they’re not even on this planet it’s like<br>they’re running across the moon<br>that’s so outdated right now<br>how dare you how dare you say it’s outdated<br>quake will never die how dare you<br>quake will never die<br>quake four is not outdated graphically that’s not outdated oh<br>yeah compared to today’s games is it really quake four oh<br>it’s way outdated really<br>john karmac<br>my brother please i’m sorry<br>forgive him for he knows not what he says<br>no i mean graphic wise really<br>i don’t know you could be right<br>i was watching the aliens and predator demo<br>that they showed the last<br>ufc was sponsored by aliens and predators the video game<br>hopefully shit that looks good yeah<br>but see even that’s like<br>not considered not top of the shell yeah<br>god damn the graphics were incredible yes<br>i remember<br>when you used to like when anybody used to be able to tell<br>what was the most advanced shit you know like i’m saying like<br>an amateur doesn’t really know what’s going on<br>you’d see something be like oh that’s the newest clearly<br>but now the levels of it<br>it’s too advanced where like like<br>i’m not an expert<br>but i’m not like somebody who’s never seen video games<br>i can’t tell all<br>the differences<br>i can’t tell like i’ll see something like that looks amazing<br>yeah that’s o fives really<br>yeah the ufc game that we’re more than turning into appearing<br>they do this exactly<br>what you become i’m not letting you go<br>i’m child child in me i gotta make sure i’m up with all the shit<br>when we went to work for the usa<br>on the video game<br>then they showed us the video game the first time<br>they showed us the video game was chuckle del versus rampage<br>and for one second<br>i looked at it i don’t remember this footage<br>like i thought it was a fight for once one second<br>i thought it was a fight oh my god<br>i’ve never seen a fight from this angle<br>i was thinking that to myself<br>and then when oh shit this is the game<br>and then once they start<br>moving i mean you could pretty much tell their video game but<br>it was so much better than i expected it to be<br>and that was a couple years ago right<br>yeah they’re<br>gonna have some shit that looks just like like a cgi movie<br>you know some of the cabins almost really look real<br>what is like what right now is the newest most amazing shit<br>mass effect two is pretty badass<br>but is that like a fighting<br>that’s like a role playing type of fighting game<br>but the one for ps<br>three that<br>just came out uncharted to drake’s fortune that is like a watch<br>being in a movie pretty much really now<br>if you look at like avatar<br>what they did with avatars<br>they took the actors and the actors made all the faces<br>and then they<br>put it through a computer and then created these blue people<br>they’re probably<br>gonna start doing that with video<br>games they already do that with video<br>games they did that with most video games no<br>but not like the way they do that with avatar not to the<br>probably the level that maybe avatar did<br>but some of their games they map out the facial features<br>and everything<br>just started from and started i think from video<br>games i just played the<br>tiger was golf ten<br>but that’s gonna be agreeable yeah like when they<br>cut to like the him<br>like his face and then they make they like<br>if he has a bad like if you have a bad shot<br>then he goes like<br>they have his voice layered into it obviously right<br>so he actually<br>makes a face he goes like tiger<br>yeah and you like oh<br>it looks like the dude right there it freaks you out<br>like you see the sweat dripping it off of them and everything<br>i feel bad for that dude there’s very few people<br>that i feel bad for in public scandals<br>that are outside of death<br>very few people i feel bad<br>i feel bad for him because i think the dude<br>got drowned on<br>he got poured on<br>more than any guy in the history of the free world<br>there’s so many ways<br>that want him out of golf because<br>he’s just destroying the sport because he’s pretty much just<br>you can’t be tiger you know<br>so there’s so many people that are attacking he knows that<br>he’s got so much money<br>he’s at home fucking washing his face with money and pussy<br>you know he’s not at home right now<br>he’s in a sex addiction he’s out of that<br>when did he get out of that<br>today’s ago<br>so you don’t think that that was like painful damn to have this<br>all the people hate nom i don’t think so i mean<br>sure i think it’s good this whole life was based on his image<br>his image was all<br>they sold it to giant corporations it was so squeaky<br>his wife finding out<br>and all that stuff like that but i think if you got in trouble<br>or if you got all this attention for something<br>as being a pimp<br>i don’t think you’re going to be like oh damn<br>i slept with a bunch of people now<br>everybody knows that sucks for my wife<br>i think it was very painful i think you’re wrong<br>i think i think you’re very much idealizing<br>and not putting a human being into that situation<br>put a human being in that situation no<br>no i mean it sir it sucks<br>but i mean dude<br>he’s never had any name he’s going to come back from this<br>so fast it’s going to retire oh<br>he’ll definitely jump out<br>you know golf wants him back more than anything though right<br>he’s the best thing for golf though yeah well<br>i think i think he is to a point but i don’t he wins everything<br>but i said i want everything<br>he doesn’t mean he’s the best golf forever but<br>there’s got to eat him<br>golf needs to make crazy<br>he’s not superstar i don’t know anything<br>about golf tell me<br>this does he lose i mean<br>what percentage of airlines does he win<br>he plays his best at the highest ache<br>but he does phenomenal i don’t know the exact numbers but<br>he loses right<br>but he’s the most he wins more than any<br>he wins he wins more than he ever loses yeah<br>but i mean he wins more than he loses way more really<br>i don’t know the exact numbers he loses tournaments all the time<br>them he doesn’t win yeah<br>but he win way more<br>even in pool even in pool the very best guys don’t always win<br>you know in pool especially<br>pools tricky like they play like race to ten<br>race to eleven<br>like to find out like which guys better<br>you really have to play like a race to a hundred<br>you know it’s like<br>then the stronger player<br>their definite strengths will<br>overcome and like whenever you see like<br>real good guys match up they match up for a lot of mind is this<br>website called the action report<br>com i love watching guys gamble on pool<br>so like one of my favorite things to watch<br>because i grew up playing pool<br>so watching these guys in the actionport<br>com they’ll set these dudes up<br>and they’ll play for like two or three days<br>and they have like a race to a hundred<br>and they’ll you know they’ll bet like twenty thousand dollars<br>and you know for these dudes that’s a lot of fucking money man<br>and they play it out and it’s it’s very exciting man<br>if you like pool but if you don’t like pool it’s deaf<br>what is it yeah<br>what is it what is it saying<br>it’s called the action report the action report dot com<br>if you guys are gambling on pool<br>super cool guys too<br>they banked all their money into putting together matches and<br>it’s all legal because it’s really like a two man tournament<br>no you call it gambling well<br>it’s not they’ve set up it’s a tournament<br>it’s just a tournament with two guys in it<br>and they put their entry fee in<br>and they play for the entry what did they do it from<br>different places different pool halls different you know<br>different places twenty thousand dollars yeah<br>and they sanctioned it as a tournament you know<br>and you know that way<br>it’s it’s all<br>totally legal like you can play pool and tournaments<br>everybody puts in<br>you know a hundred bucks<br>five hundred bucks wherever the entry fee is<br>they pull all that money together<br>and they give it to the winner<br>i mean it really is a form of it’s just like gambling you know<br>i mean just you have to<br>report that money<br>i have friends that make a living doing that max eberlee<br>it makes a living playing in pool tournaments you know<br>max emily just won three thousand dollars playing up in<br>san francisco is playing a big one in<br>la this weekend<br>this has got to be boring as fuck for people<br>johnny boy<br>o five ten says tiger banged those chicks for one reason<br>he could<br>definitely i definitely think that’s the case i mean i think<br>the truth is most people<br>that look like that dude<br>that grew up the way that guy did<br>and that lived in that guy situation<br>would probably<br>be just as nuts as he is<br>and probably fucked just as many of the girls that he fucked<br>you would go crazy<br>he’s an amazing athlete right an amazing game<br>player amazing at golf amazing<br>right a very intricate difficult complicated game<br>if he’s obsessed with things like that<br>for sure if that guy is that good<br>that he’s better than all these other people<br>that are obsessed with the game too<br>for sure that guy’s nuts<br>you almost have to be to be that good at something<br>you have to have a level of<br>concentration you have to have a level of obsession<br>that for sure<br>is going to bleed over into other areas of your life<br>into your relationships<br>of a guy who’s a fanatic<br>you know is obsessed with working out<br>might also be obsessed with fucking<br>or might also be obsessed with gambling<br>you know i mean a lot of pro athletes have like big<br>big gambling problems<br>a lot of them<br>and it’s the same thing it’s that obsession with competition<br>you know that trying to win<br>trying to get it you know that that same mindset<br>transfers over to everything<br>transfers over to how you approach arguments you know<br>how how you how you learn you know whether or not you<br>know you’re honest with yourself<br>it’s got to be nuts anybody who’s<br>the best at whatever thing i think is nuts and<br>i mean not a bad nuts<br>not like we’re criticizing people for being amazing<br>we’re just saying that almost everybody who’s like<br>you know you get to like like<br>you know the highest levels of any sport there’s something<br>about those dudes like okay<br>here’s a perfect example<br>the everybody thinks the best heavyweight is this guy<br>this russian guy<br>fade or a million anko<br>and what he’s most known for<br>you know you talk to a lot of people<br>they’ll say he’s the best pound for pound fighter in the world<br>i think it’s probably<br>anderson silva<br>but i could see the argument for it being him<br>i think gsp<br>and bjpen are more likely because i think they’re facing well<br>it’s a tough argument you know<br>he doesn’t have<br>the best competition over there<br>because he’s kind of in a situation<br>where the best guys are fighting in the ufc<br>so the guys that he’s fighting<br>they’re not really totally on his level<br>or they used to be in others<br>slid off a little bit<br>but he’s known for this insane mindset he’s known for<br>his ability to just like overcome anything and be super calm<br>like while he’s doing it you know that like he’s<br>in this like zone he<br>doesn’t make any facial expressions you know nothing yeah<br>do you think he is the best though or no<br>he’s one of the best for sure<br>but there’s something about that<br>the ability to go to war<br>with somebody with a dead face like dead calm<br>for sure there’s a discipline to it and for sure<br>it’s something that he’s learned over time<br>but also he might be crazy as fuck how about that<br>how about he he might be fucking crazy<br>you know i mean he might be so smart and so into<br>you know winning<br>and beating dudes at fighting and so<br>capable of crossing<br>boundaries that others aren’t willing to cross<br>that he might just be insane that might be why he doesn’t even<br>get angry<br>while he’s doing it he beats the fuck out of everybody<br>and then he’s super sweet<br>it draws like cartoons for his daughters and shit yeah<br>i think that probably<br>the most vicious guys in business to have the same mentality<br>like the guys that<br>take over companies and like<br>they have like<br>whoever probably runs google is probably like somebody who is<br>obsessive and<br>and has like a killed mentality<br>well definitely ceo’s for corporations oh yeah<br>they’re like hit men<br>he seems like that new show<br>what a great idea for a show i would take ceos of big companies<br>and then they go undercover and work for the company like<br>that guy from hooters<br>he’s going to<br>go to all these restaurants and act like he’s a fried cook<br>and he’s gonna work and he’s just gonna check out everything<br>and whoa<br>it’s an awesome undercover show yeah<br>it’s where they take the ceo of real companies and they<br>put them in the company undercover boss yeah<br>undercover boss that’s hilarious what a great idea it was great<br>that first episode was like<br>waste management<br>the biggest waste management company ever is called<br>wm or democrat management<br>waste management<br>and he went down<br>he was like shoveling shit out of fucking trolley or shit<br>and did they know that he was that guy<br>no no idea<br>he thought he was a regular one and then he came back<br>and all the guys that were great work<br>stuff the game raises gave him promotions<br>fixed everything<br>they were bitching about<br>they actually trying to figure out what’s awesome<br>what is it called undercover boss<br>it’s on cbs on sundays what a great idea<br>it was really good actually<br>that’s what’s wrong with people man<br>what’s really wrong with harshness and<br>people being insensitive to other people<br>people that work for them is that they don’t have to live a day<br>in their lives<br>you know you don’t have to if you did<br>you would you would be you know<br>much kinder you know it’s so easy to look at like<br>people that are like starving<br>in foreign countries<br>and you know<br>and all the fucking crazy shit that’s going on liberia<br>and all these different parts of the world are in<br>constant chaos and turmoil and starvation<br>and you don’t you don’t feel it because<br>it doesn’t affect you because on a day to day<br>basis doesn’t affect you<br>but if you had to go over there and live like that<br>just for one week<br>live like they lived<br>my god you know<br>you would realize<br>i can’t wait to see this hooter is<br>the one cause i guess it’s just like a bunch of managers<br>totally like making<br>it shakes to a bunch of shit they’re not supposed to do<br>and stuff like sexy shit it’s bad<br>yeah like sexual shit well<br>like the trailer the guy goes<br>that manages like y’all want to go home early today<br>i’ll tell those little hula<br>cooters girls<br>and they’re like yeah<br>he’s like you got to play my reindeer games<br>and then he’s making them<br>eat out of plates with no hands like a beans<br>so they like pigs eating out of a trough<br>just say<br>the company<br>is watching he can’t say<br>he’s playing undercover<br>he’s a fucking busboy or something oh my god<br>it’s great yeah he’s like manager’s a real pig<br>wow that’s amazing<br>that’s gonna be amazing yeah<br>there’s some douche bags out there oh my god<br>that’s did you imagine why would you want to work<br>a place like that<br>there’s you want to work at a place like that<br>if you’re something well<br>unless it’s a good job you know if you’re like<br>a bar manager type dude and they offer you<br>a good job organ i don’t know what hooters pay<br>so maybe they played really well<br>but you know<br>that’s a weird place to go into in the first place<br>it’s like you want to go to a trip club but not<br>really and<br>you might be with your girlfriend<br>and she’ll come on we’ll go on to be fun you want chicken<br>you heard the obsession of chicken at the same time<br>you chase on hollywood and highlands and you sports clubages<br>open where all the girls are dressed up as like schoolgirls<br>no<br>yeah they’re all dressed up like school girl<br>did you tell us about this<br>i feel like somebody told ari told me<br>there’s a thing man even if you like<br>even if the idea<br>of that is like cool to you<br>all right when you go<br>if you go somewhere like that you’re gonna be like<br>i feel like an asshole<br>you know i mean like having at a bar<br>where they’re dressed as schoolgirls you’re not going to feel<br>cool about that i had an idea once for a pizza place<br>called pizza sluts<br>worth<br>all of pizza delivered by grossing bikinis<br>pizza sluts pizza sluts yeah<br>i wanted to put it on sunset and have like super hot chicks<br>you pay them like fifty dollars an hour<br>and they walk around<br>and you know and tips and then they get tips<br>and they walk around a bikini serving pizza<br>that’s all pez<br>you can do that<br>listens out there you can have it whoever wants it<br>just let me have a<br>free piece of pizza and it’s all yours<br>i get sluts<br>i don’t wanna open up any kind of business people will come up<br>to me with business ideas and like just stop talking about best<br>script ideas all the time<br>remember that one dude that is like a ufc script you know<br>it’s a<br>yeah and to get mad if i won’t read it

what the fuck is the point of this<br>everybody wants someone else to help them<br>everybody wants someone else to get<br>get you know get them<br>in the door in hollywood<br>the crazy thing is i’m not even in the door in hollywood<br>i barely exist in this world<br>i do the commentary for the ufc<br>which is totally outside of hollywood<br>that’s sports<br>i’m a fucking sports broadcaster you know<br>and then stand up comedy<br>both of them are totally outside<br>so how am i gonna help you get a movie started what<br>am i doing you know<br>what is last time<br>i acted in that kevin james thing that’s the<br>only movie i’ve ever i did two other movies<br>and no one ever saw them<br>one of them i don’t think it ever came out well<br>maybe it came out like five years after we did it was terrible<br>it’s called venus and vegas and another one<br>forget with it frank bukkowski ci<br>it was it could have been really funny but<br>the ceos or whoever the fuck they were<br>the producers<br>i remember those dude and cuff links<br>and his fat rolex like his beautiful expensive<br>watch and this really sweet cufflinks and he had<br>what are those straps fuck those things called suspenders<br>had suspenders on<br>and this kid who is the lead of the movie is doing the scene<br>and this guy’s tom don’t do like that do it like this like hey<br>what do you guys do like he’s giving line readings<br>this dude was giving line readings<br>to this kid this really funny comedian<br>who is the lead in the movie<br>i was like wow<br>this thing is gonna go right in the toilet<br>so it was basically like<br>all these people put all this money up to make this movie<br>and then they wanted to have a say in it<br>because the kid who was<br>the lead in it was not that big of a name<br>right and they just fucked it up man<br>it’s fascinating to watch shit like that<br>that’s what makes you like really appreciate comedy<br>you know that nobody can fuck our shit up you just<br>you write it you grow up you do it<br>george you know i can tell you do it this way<br>don’t you appreciate that of course<br>something else do that though you get good well<br>you have to work those sometimes was that one you said<br>what’s that call where is it<br>pennsylvania pennsylvania yeah<br>it’s they go like they like don’t curse<br>and then what’s the place called<br>juniors juniors and what part of pennsylvania erie erie<br>junior’s an earie they go no swearing no swearing they go don’t<br>like whatever<br>this is a clean show you’re like all right and then like<br>in case you forgot six more times before you get up<br>hey man don’t forget and you’re like no<br>i heard you<br>the first five times and then like after the show they’re like<br>but didn’t you<br>suggest something like<br>did you make a joke about<br>like tits or something you’re like no<br>like somebody said you did<br>you’re like no i think i said something about like<br>i just said i look like i have a breast or something<br>and i’m like oh<br>okay well you know just try not to lean so like don’t even like<br>do say something that’s suggestive or could be perceived as<br>you know and you get a speech about it and you’re like wow<br>for how much<br>i get like a hundred thousand for like four seven<br>damn man that’s awesome<br>for not a lot<br>but how crazy is that is that they hire comics and want them<br>to well i guess as long as the comic like does that normally<br>as long as like you advertise yourself as<br>doing a squeaky clean show<br>then i can understand that well<br>you’re just they hired this guy to that did they hire you<br>under those circumstances or under that they hired agreement<br>asking can he do can he be clean okay<br>so you took the gate i took the gate i took the gate still<br>it still wasn’t fun<br>it was a place that i do when i was starting out in boston<br>we’re gonna do twenty minutes<br>i had to be squeaky clean i found it was interesting<br>it was interesting<br>but i was like i’m not really<br>accurately representing myself though i feel like oh yeah<br>and it’s not here’s the thing i took it<br>for work to get the work right<br>but the whole week<br>at no part is that fun like it’s not fun to do it<br>not because you can’t say a word you wanna say but because<br>someone told you like<br>restrict yourself<br>sense of yourself like<br>you don’t feel like you know and they’re watching you yeah<br>the whole deal about comedy is that comedy’s the best<br>best comedy comes from like<br>the loosest mind when you’re loose<br>you’re not worried about shit you’re not feeling<br>you know you know thinking that you have to you know<br>watch your step because someone’s watching you<br>and can’t say certain things<br>kinds of fucking disaster yeah<br>and i asked the<br>the guy<br>who runs an ego descent do you ever like have to fire somebody<br>and he was like oh yeah<br>because i was like cause this has to backfire<br>because they’re really strict about it<br>and they hired you know the he’s a comic the black comic<br>who was on this last season enthusiasm<br>you know what i’m talking about yeah yeah<br>you know his name he’s hilarious yeah<br>really funny guy<br>you know his name<br>really funny guy<br>well he they hired him and they told him he was like yeah yeah<br>and then he got up

anything was funny<br>i had a two hour<br>drive with a chick bitching at me<br>that i watched<br>twenty minutes of people crying cause their house is gone<br>and then i go on stage it was just death<br>but jb smooth went on right after me and destroyed destroyed<br>it was like such a stench in the room from my performance<br>it was so flat and so<br>un inspired and i was so i so didn’t want<br>and the people that paid to see me<br>they were so bummed out because<br>they had like told their friends how funny<br>i was because they saw me at naka there was a naka convention<br>this is like this<br>association of college campus activities thing where you<br>you know you’d perform<br>and then they would send you out to all these different colleges<br>all across the country was really

know i think he’s in new york right<br>dude is so funny<br>yes got some of the best facial expressions ever rogan that<br>ice shit was hilarious by the way<br>i think it’s got taken on its own little<br>thing it’s ridiculous isn’t it<br>how fun you know about this what’s that<br>there was a fight<br>on spike tv where this dude had<br>a bag of ice on the dude’s head in between the corner<br>and the bag broke<br>and ice went everywhere<br>and i’m like oh<br>gee we got a problem like look at this it’s ice everywhere<br>and these guys start picking up the ice<br>but they’re stumbling and dropping the bucket and i start<br>i start doing like play by play i’m like<br>as a goddamn three stooges<br>these guys and<br>apparently you know we’re just killing time<br>while they clean up ice basically<br>i’m like let me just entertain<br>where they’re cleaning up ice let me just make fun of this<br>and now it’s like this<br>youtube clip it’s all over the place man really it’s great<br>what sucks up being in the audience you can’t hear you<br>so i had no idea any of this was going on<br>so that sucks you know what next time<br>i’m gonna get you guys those things<br>yeah yeah there’s so much you guys those things yeah<br>i don’t know how those things work<br>maybe you can you’ll probably figure out a way to improve it oh<br>yeah this is good here’s the problem put wi fi in there<br>yeah well<br>there is a wi fi that’s available in the<br>these like headphones in the reno yes there<br>it’s an ear thing like a little like<br>sort of like an ipod and you sit there<br>and you can listen to the commentary while it’s all going on<br>yeah that would be better than yeah<br>they kind of streaming<br>it would be so much better if it was on your<br>i heard that spilled bag ice is talking shit on the internet<br>i heard you talk a lot of shit on twitter<br>and ain’t cool bro<br>that’s not professional okay<br>yeah it’s got it so yeah<br>he’s got a spillback advice as a twitter page has got like five<br>hundred followers<br>already it’s so there<br>he is<br>you should follow brian because<br>red band is trying to bump up his count<br>and he’s very upset that more people aren’t<br>what are you up to him<br>uh like eleven hundred damn do your way woman what are you guys<br>like for something<br>twitter is so hard to get people well<br>yeah<br>follow tom segora ladies gentlemen does this name down here<br>point to it come on<br>where is that thing can you see<br>yeah like that is a serious delay here yeah<br>anyway please<br>ice is commentating at ufc one on amp yeah how<br>fun is that became such a big deal<br>pants on the floor<br>that’s one thing that<br>does come in hand being a comedian and being<br>a commentator at the same time when something fucks up<br>i can at least make fun of it you do that a lot you should do it<br>well it’s not appropriate you know<br>i only do it where it’s appropriate<br>my job is to to represent what’s going on<br>my job is to represent what’s going on<br>in the fighting it’s not my job to like stick my personality<br>into that you know when it’s appropriate<br>then i do it but<br>you can’t look for like do you ever watch<br>when dennis mellow did the monday night football yes<br>and he would like throw jokes in a lot<br>right<br>jokes that would be funny as if your conversations with mike<br>kind of like you screw it yeah<br>no you do it already<br>sometimes that when mike will say something<br>you call him out on it but<br>you know<br>but if you just kind of did that more because sometimes he says<br>yeah sometimes i have to let it go though i have to<br>because like we’re in the middle of moving something along<br>someone getting into the octagon<br>you know the fights about to take place<br>i don’t want to<br>i like that side talk that you guys yeah i do too<br>but we got to do it<br>you know when it’s best when the fights are boring<br>when you have a boring fight<br>then you can start talking shit right you know<br>and you can be like honestly this isn’t the most exciting fight<br>i’ve ever seen in my life<br>like i’ll say things like that you know occasion<br>if it’s a boring one<br>do you find yourself also trying to find out new<br>sayings to sit because you always have to sit seems like<br>he has a heart of gold or something like that you are gold<br>also just cut your music song<br>he is a heart of gold<br>he is the spirit of a tiger i mean do you have a heart like<br>look there you know a bunch of animals no<br>i say the heart of a lion because it’s a genuine expression<br>right you know it’s like<br>you start making expressions up<br>he has a warrior spirit of an asian type<br>you should do that no man nobody wants to hear that<br>that’s not me though<br>but there is a dude that’s michael shavello the guy that does<br>dream he does all the commentary for dream and he does k one<br>he’s really hilarious because he’ll make stuff up<br>but it’s really funny coming for him<br>like when this guy was throwing hooks<br>goes more hooks than a pirate’s convention<br>like he says like that<br>it’s funny<br>the thing about dennis millers was that his were obscure yeah<br>that whole style<br>that whole style of comedy that whole style like<br>i know much more than you do<br>and you know you’re gonna pretend that you know<br>as much as i do you’re<br>you’re in the inside so you’re gonna laugh at the joke right<br>exactly that if it’s not even a joke just a reference<br>you hear brian’s example<br>of specific one though it looks like the constitution page<br>i was his idea vink’s big obscure<br>page two constitution<br>not a line from it page<br>it’s really funny if you think about how a few people really<br>understand or have written read the constitution<br>i’ve never read it<br>have you ever read it<br>i think i might have never read it constitution yeah<br>i think it had to you can yeah maybe<br>like do you remember any of it<br>i mean do you remember anything<br>about i remember<br>freedom of speech<br>i remember you’re supposed to be allowed to have<br>guns and you’re allowed to take up arms<br>against the government isn’t that legal something like that<br>and that like second amendment<br>bill rights<br>it’s really kind of crazy if you stop and think about like<br>how the structure of our country<br>the whole structure of our country<br>is made up in a way that very few people have even looked into<br>you know you’ll talk about it’s unconstitutional but<br>you know how many people have ever read that shit<br>it’s got to be like a minus fuel percentage<br>and it’s so crazy that we stick with these laws that<br>were invented like so many<br>hundred years ago like why haven’t we come up with a better way<br>why haven’t we refined it and made it better<br>just for the people like when you hear it like<br>new rulings like this<br>recent ruling that the supreme court had where<br>they said that corporations can spend as much<br>money as they want<br>on campaigns now they’re just like an individual<br>could spend as much as they want that’s an insane idea<br>why would you think that that would be good for the individual<br>why would you think<br>that would be good for human beings in general<br>that’s only gonna be good for the corporation<br>of course<br>you’re gonna spend millions of dollars because the politician<br>who’s gonna get an office is gonna<br>do shit that he doesn’t really want to do<br>but you asked him to do<br>which is why you got him in there<br>in the first place<br>you know i mean<br>nobody gets into office that isn’t playing the game<br>i mean it’s pretty obvious now you have to work with obama<br>and obama’s a smart fucking yeah<br>man you know i saw him that thing that<br>he was doing where<br>the republicans were questioning on<br>shit and saying a bunch of nonsense<br>and he was just<br>correcting them<br>left and right<br>and made them all look stupid and did it without a teleprompter<br>and was calm as fuck under pressure and you watched that<br>guy can’t even change anything<br>change anything<br>and everybody’s like a bum’s a puppet a bum’s a puppet maybe<br>maybe<br>or president it might be that he can’t fucking change anything<br>it might be that your president is president yeah<br>it’s just here’s a pup yeah<br>that’s the whole point<br>it might be that the president really is i mean<br>i think like jfk tried to treat the presidency as if he was like<br>really the president<br>you know but i think bush<br>very obviously accepted the position of the spokesperson<br>very obviously wasn’t paying attention right<br>very obviously<br>you know would make like critical mistakes about<br>shit and the way he promoted things<br>and the way he spoke about things when he was you know<br>when he was off script i mean he was not fucking dance<br>and then you had cheney who was always hiding in the bunker<br>and his fucking evil billionaire ceo character who was actively<br>making money off the war actively profiting<br>i mean that’s some incredible shit<br>and then when the company that he<br>used to be the ceo of<br>then becomes the fucking company<br>that’s contracted to go to iraq and fix everything<br>jesus christ and everybody goes well<br>that’s because you know<br>there’s the only company that’s qualified like oh<br>so what so what<br>so what fire up a new company that’s crazy<br>the guy can’t make money as the vice president from fucking war<br>and then obama comes in the office and you gotta go like well<br>you know it’s like he ain’t fixing shit<br>you know what is what is he changing<br>sending thirty thousand more people to afghanistan<br>you know i mean this whole economic stimulus<br>when i hear them talk about that<br>i feel i feel angry<br>i feel like i am getting fucked right now<br>and i don’t know i’m getting fucked<br>like the way they’re talking about this<br>and the money that gets an effect<br>the goldman sachs<br>ceo who just got you know some insanely large bonus<br>when i was reported online<br>it was a hundred million dollars or something like that<br>some insane bonus<br>because they made so much money in two thousand and nine<br>they had like that record year<br>it’s incredible<br>it’s all incredible<br>it’s all incredible the whole the whole idea that you know<br>that they buy out all these fucking banks<br>because the banks are too big to fail<br>and where is all the money going<br>it’s all numbers<br>it’s all ones and zeros what the fuck is happening<br>and where is it going<br>it’s all nuts like the whole system is so chaotic<br>a system of finance that’s based mostly unconfidence<br>that’s a big part of it you know because for the longest time<br>we didn’t have shit<br>we weren’t producing shit<br>but everybody was like confident that real estate<br>prices were gonna<br>keep going up<br>so they keep buying them and selling them to keep making money<br>so everybody’s confident<br>meanwhile in the middle of all of it nothing is going on<br>there’s just ones zeros moving back and forth<br>we don’t even know what the fuck is happening<br>and it runs our whole life you know<br>when the financial system that runs the world<br>it’s like so fucking complex<br>that a guy like birdie made off can fuck them all and steal<br>billions and billions of dollars<br>and nobody do<br>that’s absurd that’s insane billions and he didn’t steal like<br>fifty grand he stole fifty billion<br>and he had that much<br>yeah over decades<br>he had that much<br>money going on and no one knew what the fuck was happening<br>and he used to be the president<br>i think of the stock exchange yeah<br>yeah he’s the guy who’s like<br>in charge of it all was he the charon or something like yeah<br>it was some big<br>big position at the yeah<br>it’s incredible man it’s really amazing yeah it really is man<br>it’s<br>i mean i used to think before the market crashed i thought well<br>i don’t want to spend too much time thinking about you know<br>finances and politics because<br>it’s so complex to really study<br>it appropriately<br>you would have to spend many many hours every day<br>delving into all the different issues that are going on<br>all the different areas that merit attention<br>it’s like god damn it<br>it’s more than a full time job and if you have a family<br>if you have kids if you have a job if you have a hobby<br>if you have any friends where are you coming up with that time<br>where are you coming up with that time<br>are you going to get obsessed with politics<br>i don’t have it do you have it<br>who the fuck does that’s incredible so<br>the system that is running<br>our whole lives is one that we barely understand<br>and have it even researched<br>they have to do nothing but consume information all day<br>to have even<br>remote chance to like<br>really follow the ins and outs<br>so that’s in the same bucket as math with me yeah<br>my brain just doesn’t work like that<br>and math<br>oh do you think by the way that<br>like i don’t know i go to for obama<br>and so i’ve been like you know i wanted to<br>succeed and do well and everything<br>but and i don’t here’s how out of it<br>i am with the politics that i don’t know<br>if this is a factual or not but<br>was his campaign part of it that like he would withdraw troops<br>so is it sending them yeah<br>at least at the very least<br>it’s the opposite of what you said you were going no<br>i think he did withdrawal troops but i think he just<br>when everyone says he sent that many trips afghanistan<br>he just withdrew him and moved him over well<br>everybody knew it was bullshit everybody knew it was bullshit<br>thirty thousand more now<br>right now right<br>i don’t know<br>i shouldn’t say<br>everybody knew it was bullshit<br>but a lot of people<br>knew that<br>what he really was gonna do is pull troops out of iraq<br>and put more in afghanistan<br>because they were saying that we’re<br>under trooped in afghanistan for what they’re trying to do right<br>but you know<br>it’s kind of crazy that the dude wins the nobel peace prize<br>and then sends thirty thousand more people to afghanistan right<br>afterwards that’s just i mean<br>it’s all even like not<br>it doesn’t make sense<br>award somebody at peace prize just on<br>their image well<br>you know we gotta pay attention everybody’s like well<br>you gotta look out for where<br>you know things are happening you have protect american<br>you know interest and<br>protect america from terrorism and all that good stuff<br>but listen the scariest goddamn threat to america is<br>the max kin drug cartels<br>they’re right next door to us you can drive<br>to fucking mexico now<br>it’s right there<br>and if you live in san diego<br>it’s a goddamn twenty minute drive<br>and you’re in another country<br>where they’re murdering people every<br>fucking day of the week way crazier<br>victor davila the guy who does the spanish version of my job<br>he does their commentary ufc<br>he told me that it’s five times more people have died<br>last year in two thousand nine<br>in waras and all the border towns all the murders and<br>the gun fire that’s going on between the cops and the bad guys<br>five times more have died than in iraq and afghanistan combined<br>ever that’s insane that’s insane that’s right there<br>he said it’s nuts over there<br>he said you have to drive around at night with your light<br>your dome light on<br>so that the drug cartels<br>they see they don’t wonder who you are in the car<br>they don’t just gun your car down<br>just to just to be sure really yeah<br>he said<br>it’s nuts man people drive around with their dome lights on<br>so the drug guys can see inside<br>whoa that’s fucking terrifying<br>you’re driving around and they let you live<br>let him live<br>let him live he doesn’t have our guys in there whoa<br>how scary is that shit and that’s right next door man<br>you know<br>and the reason why it all happened is because drugs are illegal<br>that’s the reason why it all happened is<br>you got all these fucking people that are willing to sell drugs<br>because all these people want drugs<br>and the people that are selling<br>the drugs make billions and billions of dollars<br>and they don’t realize that a lot of people think that’s all<br>cocaine<br>the biggest import from mexico in the illicit drug world is<br>marijuana so it’s the fact that that’s illegal<br>that fuels a lot i’m saying if you made<br>it legal in mexico united universally<br>you would you would get rid of a lot of the<br>violence and things that go on because<br>the biggest thing that’s being brought in is not coke<br>it’s marijuana so the fact that these guys have<br>are doing this because it’s illegal if they just made it legal<br>you would reduce violence by so much<br>but you know what they’re not going to<br>cut down any laws they don’t absolutely have to cut down<br>and if they ease up restrictions on<br>marijuana it’s going to take decades<br>it’s going to be statewide and california first<br>and there’s going to be some contest to that<br>and maybe a couple other states adopt<br>it it’ll never be national<br>it’ll never be federal because<br>they always need those fucking people to work<br>they need those dea guys<br>those guys are going to make sure<br>that they’re in a position of power<br>they’re going to make sure that<br>they keep a certain amount of jobs every year<br>and if you close down<br>marijuana you make marijuana legal you make all drugs<br>you criminalize all drugs then you’re chopped down like<br>more than half<br>more than half the people in prison<br>today are in prison for non violent drug offenses<br>which is crazy<br>when you can go to cvs and get fucked up out of your mind<br>you got a cvs<br>you know and they have shelves where they have fucking whiskey<br>just shelve after<br>just so much whiskey you could drink yourself to death right<br>there i go to cvs now to buy the<br>cheapest beer now it’s crazy<br>i mean it’s amazing that alcohol kills people<br>and yet we don’t even bat an eye<br>at it being right there on the corner in a convenience store<br>like hard hard shit jack daniel’s wild turkey and shit you know<br>right there<br>you know i mean<br>liquor stores supermarkets right there<br>beer wine drink yourself to death<br>but if they had weed<br>people would freak out<br>this fucking weed here<br>there is a difference when you think about it<br>there’s not one alcohol where you could take one shot<br>and then and be<br>out of your mind<br>panic attacks might check yourself in the hospital for<br>because you think your heart’s freaking out you know<br>there’s not one alcohol that will do that<br>but yet there is weed that you take one hit and you will<br>think you’re having it<br>especially if you don’t smoke weed<br>yeah there was a glass of something you can drink<br>and like if you had a<br>a glass of it yeah<br>i mean the glass of it<br>eating a whole bag of weed well that’s the reason<br>it’s good that things are legal is because<br>when things are legal<br>they have like really clearly defined portions right<br>you know a beer you get a beards<br>twelve ounces<br>or whatever the hell it is<br>crack it open there it is that’s a beer<br>if you have more than one<br>now you know it’s like when you have two beers right<br>you have two beers now be careful<br>you know like with weed<br>especially when you buy<br>like edibles you don’t know what you’re getting<br>you could get like some i’ve had at<br>pot lollipops where i couldn’t even feel them<br>like i eat the whole lollipop and<br>two hours later like i think i got a dud like it was a dud<br>and then you’ll have a cookie where you eat half the cookie<br>and you’ll see like<br>cartoons fucking behind your eyelids like you close your eyes<br>and you’ll see like these animated cartoons like<br>wrestling and duplicating and moving back and forth all<br>around<br>you and that’s beyond colors that’s how i felt the last usc whoo<br>and it was a little bit too strong i thought it was gonna die<br>we talked about this before<br>but it’s worth talking about because it’s so crazy<br>and most people don’t know about it<br>when you eat marijuana and this is very important for people<br>who think you know<br>i got two stone<br>you can get two stones smoking pot it’s totally different<br>than getting two stone to eating pot<br>getting two stone eating pot is terrifying<br>because your body produces a chemical called<br>eleven hydroxy metabolite<br>and when apparently what happens is when you smoke marijuana<br>this is what i read online when you smoke marijuana<br>it has this eleven hydroxy metabolite but it’s not psychoactive<br>but when you eat it<br>and it’s processed through your liver<br>and it goes in your bloodstream it’s four<br>times more potent and thc<br>four times more psychoactive<br>so that’s why you get so high<br>you eat a brownie and you’re just like blitz creaked<br>like it’s literally like higher than you can get smoking it<br>you know like it’s a different high too it’s like<br>it’s almost like mushrooms or something<br>it’s really self examining<br>you know<br>real self examinatory like you really start like is that a word<br>self examined as a word<br>sounds like a word<br>but it sounds like it’s a word<br>maybe right it should be alright<br>that’s freaked out i freaked out with a cookie one time woo<br>i was crying and stuff like a long time too<br>it was hours and hours now yeah<br>eddie had a cookie once that really freaked him out and he<br>was doing this character<br>this<br>was a white rapper that puts black face on<br>to be more street and he was doing this character<br>and it was like the ultimate wigger<br>he was like<br>trying to claim that he really didn’t have makeup obviously did<br>it was a pretty funny accent<br>and he ate the cookie and got so paranoid because of this video<br>he started to freak out<br>and he thought the black people were gonna come and get him<br>and they were gonna hate him<br>he was racist<br>and he was like ready to cry<br>i mean he was talking about it he was like you know<br>that’s funny<br>it’s so funny how when you get high<br>like i got high once that i thought about<br>some shit i said about steven cigar<br>i always like making<br>fun of steven cigar and i was being like really mean<br>and then i got high once<br>and i thought about i’m like why am i being such a dick<br>steve is a girl never did anything to me<br>like i’m being so personal about it about<br>my making fun of him like i’m not even doing it good naturedly<br>you know it made me realize i was like what if i met him<br>what if he was nice<br>what kind of a piece of shit what i feel like<br>you know i mean maybe he’s not nice but maybe he is<br>maybe i mean maybe i like him<br>you know i mean i’ve met some people<br>that people thought were douchebags before<br>and i liked them<br>so it made me really examine like<br>my instincts<br>just because this guy’s famous just to shit all over him<br>that’s all i wanted to do i was just i just met riding piper<br>he was a nicest<br>old man i’ve ever said riding piper is a legend man<br>yeah but when you see him though you’re like who is this guy<br>he was just like off the streets but really yeah<br>nicest guy ever<br>well i’m still acting why isn’t he acting<br>i guess tv shows and shit have you watched the gold show<br>fuck it awesome<br>stevens gold shows goddamn i don’t like it you don’t like it<br>don’t you like me talks black to black<br>i did it it’s worth that little key what’s going on<br>what you’re trying to do here we’re going down we’re going down<br>like he will straight up patronize he goes right to<br>cause what up cause like right away<br>these guys are handcuffed is this his gun even real<br>does he keep real bullets in his guns i don’t need<br>zany let him have bullets in his gun<br>i’m so weird about that show just to me it just seems like i’m<br>getting i mean<br>i kind of understand okay<br>he has real martial arts training<br>gotcha he’s got real firearms training gotcha<br>he would bring exposure to your police force okay<br>i see where you’re coming from<br>i can kind of understand<br>how they would be willing to have him as a cop<br>but it’s strange<br>you know it’s like you think<br>the people would be smarter you think<br>the people would be like do you think in israel<br>they would let some of us just along be a cop<br>in israel do you think they would let him go<br>you could be twelve year old and be here<br>well it would make you<br>but you know i’m saying do you think they would<br>take an actor and<br>i don’t know let him do that no yeah<br>they might think that listen<br>they said they’d be like in a game in the movie yeah<br>they might say no joke how about this the gall is is<br>an expert in every episode awesome shit that he’s like he’s like<br>you know i would train a dogs<br>and then he’s playing the blues really you play the blues well<br>you know what’s funny<br>there was a spy magazine article about him<br>about his background about how<br>a guy was claiming that his background was fabricated<br>and that there was a dude who really worked for the cia<br>in southeast asia<br>and segal<br>medam and sergal started telling this guy’s stories as his own<br>he just started doing this guy’s life yeah<br>that did a great movie yeah oh yeah well<br>i do this completely full of shit<br>but he’s not totally full of shit because he really is like this<br>high level aikido blackbell<br>i mean akio is kind of a silly martial art<br>but he’s really like a high level akioba i do<br>think that that’s completely true an accurate<br>and i do believe that he is a little out of his mind yeah well<br>he’s definitely i was mine<br>but i mean how many people have you ever met in show business<br>that aren’t out of their mind no<br>but when you become an action superstar and i think<br>he kind of wanted to be<br>the characters in the movies he was playing like<br>he wanted to be out for jessica real after he did that shit<br>and he was like i’m gonna go be a cop<br>you know<br>he acts like i just said i’m just another cop no you’re not<br>you’re fucking six so crazy<br>i’ve been training eagles to wear hats for twenty years<br>you got where the ponytail was very disappointed<br>i was hoping he was gonna rock the ponytail<br>the ponytail kind of makes it with him man there’s something<br>about him having that ponytail<br>it makes him look more like samurai style you know yeah<br>i like that ponytail i think he should rock that shit<br>i just realized what it is about his films<br>the expression that he’d never had in the film and i was always<br>like<br>kind of wondering what he’s never been out of breath<br>like he never you know i mean his face was always in control<br>even after finally tendu to turn the last dude<br>and not be brief well how about the one<br>with kelly lebrock where he was in a coma<br>for like years<br>and then he came out of coma and just<br>got some fucking acupuncture<br>and did some meditate next i’m gonna always punch<br>in bricks and shit and running uphills on back<br>back in shape like he gets back in shape<br>after being in a coma for years<br>he gets back in shape like a couple days you know<br>he’s punching the makiwar out there in the desert and shed<br>doing his forms meditating<br>incense hilarious he’s pleased your show on the air oh<br>he’s genius man his movies are even better man<br>his movies are goddamn classic<br>i ordered some movie

richard heat<br>you guys have to see it richard heat order it<br>is it on dvd<br>i think so i’ve seen the trail at the extension of heat oh<br>you saw<br>me the preview of it and i laptop was that yeah<br>yeah that’s hilarious<br>that’s real it’s a full length film that’s funny<br>one of you guys gonna broadcast an hd on justin tv<br>justin tv has hd this roll hard character<br>on the rogue board says they do he doesn’t have it<br>they don’t have it for mac<br>and it’s not<br>they don’t have it from matt i don’t think it’s really hd<br>it’s not really hd<br>but all these guys have better<br>video quality on pcs really<br>well why don’t we start running in front of pc<br>let’s run boot camp and boot camp here<br>i don’t mind putting boot camp is it that big with deal<br>it’s not hard right<br>i had it on this computer and<br>it was just knocking<br>brian hates windows<br>i just don’t want to put windows on my laptop<br>you’re like a big fan of windows one wrong email my shit’s all<br>fuck<br>maybe we should get a pc just to do this<br>should we get a pc just to do this maybe<br>i might buy a computer for you faggots how about that<br>broadcast<br>what a confusing message daddy sends us<br>who call us all faggots<br>kind of a fucking show is this<br>brian did you have<br>apples wade like when they were first coming out<br>were you into them then<br>like when we were at apples well<br>i mean elementary school i had i used an apple one to disney<br>i’m saying where did you like them then<br>i like them back then but<br>i grew up with pcs just because i was a broke ass<br>to<br>build my own computers and stuff like that<br>you build your own computers<br>i can still do that<br>and that scares you<br>i made a couple computers<br>i built a couple computers from scratch<br>what the fuck are you guys man well<br>i mean i’m not<br>good at it i need someone to help me along the way like<br>my friend andrew’s<br>psycho genius and he knows that<br>he used to make computers for a living<br>and i could always call him like dude i’m fucked up<br>i didn’t flash the bios help me tell him what to do here<br>you know i could get<br>but it’s not that hard it’s like once you understand<br>that a motherboard is for a certain cpu<br>and you know that they match and you know how to put it on<br>and you have all the pieces<br>you know where it goes<br>then you know where the memory goes<br>then you know where the hard drive goes it’s not that hard<br>and then the hard part is getting it to boot up loading windows<br>and then getting all your peripherals you<br>keyboards on that shit<br>to sink up at least it used to be back in the windows<br>you know<br>ninety five and ninety eight days that was when i started<br>that’s when i was making computers<br>but i would make my own pcs<br>we just go to fries and buy a box<br>sounds really intimidating it’s not that hard man<br>it’s really not that hard it’s really plugging<br>because i don’t know any coding i don’t know<br>when i would like go into<br>i knew like command<br>prompts for certain things in windows you know<br>i knew how to ping servers and stuff like that but there’s most<br>shit i didn’t know and most shit was just<br>things that friends told me all right<br>read a book on or something like that it’s a lot easier now<br>to jumper settings yeah<br>it was oh yeah there was always and you had to have<br>the memory and the right slot or it wouldn’t boot right<br>you know<br>you put the memory in the wrong slot it didn’t recognize it<br>because they have to start with this one yeah<br>frequencies cannot match with the video cards can yeah<br>and then if you got crazy once you really got cocky<br>you started overclocking your shit<br>you know you’re like well<br>you know it says three hundred megahers<br>but i think i’d get out three fifty and not burn it out<br>but nowadays i just like max yeah<br>it’s way easier for creative work<br>and stuff it’s way easier but<br>they’re way more expensive<br>you know as long as you’re not stupid<br>it really don’t mac mini so<br>you can get a referved for four hundred dollars that’s way<br>faster than any<br>right but if you want to get a laptop man you get a<br>badass fucking laptop for twelve hundred bucks from windows<br>from mac you<br>get the macbook<br>which is like a thousand bucks and it’s pretty good<br>man twelve hundred bucks you can get a windows laptop that has<br>blu ray<br>and has one terabyte fucking hard drive<br>you know they have more shit man that<br>you get more bang for your buck if you buy<br>a windows one<br>more shit for your pennies<br>you know that the quality is not as good<br>i mean the thing about max is like you get<br>like one of those power books<br>like the keyboards badass<br>like the way it’s the form factors like really<br>solid like the build qualities excellent<br>like sometimes you get a pc laptop and it’s like plastic<br>and it feels like it’s falling apart you’re definitely<br>somewhat like<br>sony’s my favorite pc yeah<br>there’s you know there’s high end companies man<br>there’s high end companies that make like dope shit<br>but it’s important to have a bunch of different options man<br>it’s important for you know<br>there’d be a windows and a mac and a linux and a eunuch and<br>it should be more there should be more different<br>things that people could choose from make these motherfuckers<br>come out with the best shit quickest you know<br>look how much better windows is now why because of max os ten<br>you know<br>they had to catch up they had to come up with those cool shit<br>you know all this stuff that looks cool to look at you know<br>i mean that’s all that is<br>people think that’s nonsense<br>i don’t need that i just need a computer to work<br>that’s all fun<br>it’s a part of the experience it makes the experience<br>it gives it more flavor you know<br>just regular computing i like<br>the when you go down to an application and it bounces up and<br>when you load it<br>it goes doing doing<br>yeah it’s part of an experience of avenue yeah<br>it’s fun<br>you know it’s horrible it was using a pc the other day<br>and it says you have updates<br>click here to restart<br>or it says restart later<br>and you’re like no i don’t want to restart now restart later<br>every three minutes that same window will pop up<br>like there’s no way to just say hey<br>leave me alone<br>i’ll restart it when i want to this is not a pc yeah<br>this isn’t a pc it can’t stop time<br>no no i forgot how annoying that used to be<br>is like we start later we start now<br>you know yeah<br>it’s like come on i said we start later a million<br>times they’re definitely not up to where wind<br>where mac is<br>but i think they’re a lot closer than they used to be<br>i think window seven is supposed to get pretty goddamn close<br>just guys asking about mark emory<br>a couple people are asking about them<br>someone was saying the mark emory the prince of pot<br>arjay leblanc<br>another guy saying as a canadian<br>i’m ashamed we’re extraditing mark emory it’s a black eye<br>he’s a dude in canada that was selling pot seeds<br>he was selling seeds just seeds on the internet<br>and seeds you know italy no store<br>and you sell them all over the world the united states<br>they wanted him arrested for being a drug dealer<br>personal seeds personal seeds<br>now they’re gonna charge like major<br>millions and dollars in trafficking<br>you know<br>there’s all the seeds that could have been turned into pot<br>and could have been sold<br>and he’s a drug dealer fucking seeds for a plant i mean<br>it is so amazing<br>it’s so amazing that they could pull that shit off<br>you know<br>i mean it’s the dumbest thing ever there’s the whole idea<br>that you can have anything<br>that doesn’t affect other people and you can make it illegal<br>you can make anything illegal that doesn’t why why<br>how the fuck can you tell one person<br>with a kenneck can’t experience<br>i mean it’s pretty incredible but yeah you can buy those<br>it’s mind boggling that this is still going<br>on i would have thought that with the internet and everything<br>that this would all be fixed by now<br>like there’s so much more access to information<br>there’s so much more transparency we know like how everything<br>you know supposed to be in place we know the real<br>history behind pot and<br>why how is it still here<br>how’s that still going on tom fix that<br>do it fix it fix it bitch do it right now<br>i’m not gonna fix anything tom squirrel got down<br>it’s crazy it’s like constitution page two page two<br>two thousand ten<br>it’s like when are we<br>not gonna have bad words when are we not gonna have<br>ridiculous laws<br>you can’t for sure<br>you can’t just go and make drugs legal<br>that can’t happen<br>because<br>then people are going to sell the drugs everywhere there’s one<br>thing that’s good<br>about drugs being illegal<br>the only thing that’s good about it is that it’s hard<br>for those people to move around<br>like when you’re talking about<br>heroin and math and shit like that<br>it’s hard for them to sneak around and sell that shit<br>like if you watch that documentary there’s documentary on<br>oxycontin called the oxycon express<br>it’s about florida where they have<br>no database in florida so anybody can just<br>get a doctor’s prescription and go to these health management<br>clinics and you get<br>some oxycon<br>you can go like a mile down the road to another one gets more<br>and another one go yeah<br>they don’t have<br>a database connecting all these patients together<br>so these all these people have problems with oxycontins<br>and they have like<br>it’s a one stop shop<br>they have the doctor in the pharmacy right there in the place<br>so you go in you see the doctor<br>the doctor gives you a prescription<br>you go right next door you get some heroin<br>i mean it’s fun but nuts man you know what’s amazing is that<br>with weed is that obviously the reason when reason<br>anything exists is because it generates<br>cash flow you know people make money off of having something<br>legal or e legal or why they allow something<br>because you can make money from it<br>it makes you wonder<br>wouldn’t they eventually make more money<br>with we being legal like<br>isn’t that something that could be<br>profitable<br>wouldn’t be profitable for everybody the problem<br>is you can’t control it<br>see if you’re selling gasoline<br>i mean<br>you can’t just get gasoline man you gotta go to the dude who is<br>buying it from the dude who’s pumping it<br>i mean or the one company that’s pumping it<br>and refining it and then shipping it and<br>it’s fucking very hard what do you take control<br>that i’m saying that you know business structure well<br>the problem you would have is you would probably<br>have some sort of a deal<br>that’s very similar to what they have with farmers right now<br>was like with farmers<br>like say if you have like corn<br>you buy like corn scenes from<br>monsanto or whatever the fucking you know<br>those companies are that are<br>you know huge<br>crop companies<br>well they own those seeds<br>man you can’t like extract those seeds<br>from this year’s crop and then<br>plant them again next year<br>no they’ll they’ll fucking sue you if you do that right<br>like you’re not allowed to use those seeds again<br>they like lease you those seeds for like a season<br>it’s really pretty crazy like they patent plants<br>and the thing about genetically modified<br>you know foods<br>like there’s there’s two concerns<br>people out they could have to concern about diseases<br>because like these things are immune because<br>they’re not natural you create them<br>and what if they get diseases and what if<br>those diseases are transmittal to humans<br>or whatever you know<br>what what if<br>but if you know there’s<br>animals that eat them and they get sick and you<br>know whatever<br>that’s one concern of people out<br>but the other concern is that someone’s gonna own<br>the patent to fucking plants<br>you genetically modify<br>like a type of corn or a tomato or something like that<br>and<br>you get those seeds to a certain level you want them<br>you can fucking copyright those that’s my corn<br>yeah that’s their shit<br>that’s unbelievable<br>so like if someone in another farm<br>down the road<br>like you know maybe somehow other seeds got into<br>his<br>his farm and they find that<br>you know<br>this guy is illegally growing corn with their seeds<br>they can put that guy in jail<br>for fucking seeds<br>how did anybody allow that to happen<br>so if<br>there was weed would there just be too much cross<br>I don’t know<br>I mean I just think at a certain point time<br>the monkey would be out of the cage<br>if weed became legal<br>the problem is once weed becomes legal<br>you’re never gonna get that genie back in the hole<br>you would have to they would have to have some massive<br>government campaign of propaganda and disinformation<br>where people were smoking weed and<br>jumping off cliffs and<br>you know and shooting themselves in the head<br>they would have to do something like that<br>we’re we’re mass<br>chaos is falling because the marijuana<br>today is too strong<br>and you would have like fucking<br>dan rather when we talk it is you so love<br>he’s alive you would have one of those dudes on tv<br>you know talking about how this<br>mass suicides or happening all across the country<br>directly linked to this new<br>alaskan ak 47 weed being sold in Southern California<br>in tacos my brother was doing great<br>then just start smoking weed and<br>jumped from the biggest car you can find<br>you waited what you’re standing on the side of the road<br>I’m like what are you doing man<br>we could get a run across the highway look not yet<br>not yet they ran boom so you couldn’t take anymore<br>that’s how good the weed is<br>and that’s what we would see night day every day<br>it was just until<br>the president got on tv and said<br>obviously we made a mistake<br>we need to pull back<br>we need to gather off our resources<br>we need to look at this intelligently<br>we’ve got a situation<br>we made it we tried it<br>didn’t work out okay<br>we know what’s best for our country<br>we know what’s best for our country<br>we did make $100 billion first yeah before<br>but now we’re gonna pull the plug on<br>I think the problem<br>is that the money would get distributed the wrong way<br>you know<br>we live in a company we live in society right now<br>that’s controlled by a series of companies<br>and these gigantic corporations like oil companies and<br>they have<br>they’re making so much money doing it this way<br>that there’s no incentive whatsoever to change<br>it would have to be a moment where<br>they knew that we’re on<br>like peak oil place<br>you know where<br>literally we’re running out of<br>petroleum like there’s no more left in the world<br>there’s no way we can keep this going<br>and if we ever got to that space<br>then they would have to do something<br>but until they do they’re not going to change shit man<br>if you<br>switch to an agriculture based society<br>that’s running off<br>you know corn ethanol and you know<br>and you can make fuel at a hamp too man<br>you can make all kinds of fuel<br>you can make oils out of hamp<br>you can make plastic out of hamp you can make<br>a particle board that’s like five times stronger than<br>most wood like hamp that’s like a<br>really strong wood<br>it makes incredible paper it makes incredible cloth<br>and it’s all illegal<br>it should really be like way further along<br>with solar power<br>isn’t that really effective<br>it’s not as easy as it looks really yeah<br>it’s hard to extract energy from the sun like that<br>very difficult<br>I mean<br>they’re much more fishing at it now than they were<br>just a few years ago<br>you know but it’s still not quite there<br>it’s very<br>I know about it because we were looking into it<br>when I was living in colorado<br>you can’t quite<br>power a house on solar power it’s very hard<br>you have to have a lot of panels<br>and to go straight solar<br>it has to be sunny a lot<br>like if it snows and rains for a few days you know<br>you ain’t getting any light<br>my dad had it set up<br>he built his own<br>solar collectors and put it on his house and he just<br>had it just so it heated his water<br>and he’s gonna<br>I guess<br>do it sometime in the future and have it do something<br>like that word<br>this is only going to do this you know<br>but but still it’s like hey heat<br>you know my friend tom did it in Oregon<br>and he used windmills<br>right and he had so much power he was generating<br>probably selling back<br>yeah come on<br>yeah how many more people aren’t doing that<br>it’s not cheap man<br>he was a director<br>he was a director and he had a lot of money and<br>he had a badass farm up there<br>and he put it all together<br>that’s incredible yeah pretty interesting<br>I have<br>so much power installing a bag of the power company<br>yeah<br>he was a smart dude very very selfish he was funny man<br>he’s one of the few men that I’ve ever met in my life<br>that does not like kids<br>had kids and does not like them really yep<br>because<br>I think they start hating them<br>around<br>12 he had kids who said it ruined his relationship<br>said it wasn’t fun<br>it goes totally changes the whole relationship<br>I don’t like kids<br>he’s got this new wife after he divorced his wife<br>and you know<br>the kids are full row and divorce his wife<br>got some new chicken<br>didn’t want to kids<br>he goes in I like her just fine we get a long terrific<br>I’m not gonna bring in kids and fuck this up<br>I think his kids just change the whole relationship<br>the movie director tv director<br>it’s a character man<br>but yeah they don’t quite have it to the point we can<br>be totally self sufficient on it’s just solar power<br>but couldn’t like<br>let’s say even if the isn’t I’m saying the wind<br>you know power<br>so effective that like at least the government would<br>invest more and using that like maybe not<br>every individual person<br>but<br>they would want to use that more because it’s cheaper<br>I mean then over time buying<br>I don’t know if it works that way because I think<br>in order to have enough power from windmills<br>to power your house and keep all your shit going<br>you have to have pretty significant windmills<br>you know<br>like you can’t have it for an apartment building<br>for everybody in the fucking building<br>that’s going to be using all that power<br>for an office building<br>it’s like no you need more power than that<br>you’re not gonna have<br>windmills are gonna power a fucking office building<br>you’re gonna need like a whole field windmills you know<br>it’s gonna be ridiculous<br>to the point where it’s not economically viable<br>I guess they have to<br>they have to consider all that shit<br>I think the problem is once we have a solution<br>we kind of like stop looking how to have<br>you know a different way to do it like<br>you know people go well<br>you know<br>we need to figure out cars that run on anything else<br>but we got cars to run on gas<br>they’re pretty badass<br>and I really don’t really want to fuck with cars that<br>run on hydrogen<br>I mean<br>they only get to the point where they have to do it<br>I think the future<br>because it seems like right now we’re having<br>so much electronics that we’re using more and more<br>and more and more power<br>but I think once the future catches up<br>technology catches up we’re going to have<br>less and less<br>we’re not going to have a stereo and a phone in a tv<br>and we’re just going to have one<br>thing that does all this shit<br>we could do it perfect<br>I think you could have balanced itself out<br>so you know yeah maybe maybe<br>but you know I wonder<br>when they have like electric cars like they have that<br>tesla you know that tesla electric car<br>it’s interesting it doesn’t handle that well<br>one of the reasons why it doesn’t handle that well<br>is because there’s someone that’s weight in the back<br>right there’s all these batteries in the back<br>and in the front<br>there’s like nothing<br>well<br>battery technology seems to be the one thing that’s<br>kind of hit a wall completely<br>but I think<br>you know it’s just one invention away from going<br>over that wall right right right<br>yeah I think you’re right<br>I think they’re gonna come out with some<br>fucking crazy new thing<br>that allows you to get like 1 million times more<br>information on<br>a single cell<br>can hold more at this battery last five years yeah<br>the battery will never die yeah<br>you imagine<br>but if you crack it open it makes a black hole<br>it eats the end<br>you will lose your penis<br>you break this battery<br>you know it’s covered in the same<br>shit that wolverine’s bones are made out of it<br>at mandyum you know<br>you can’t get through it with bullets<br>you can run over with a car and it won’t break<br>if it did break<br>but whoever invents who breaks that battery wall is a<br>like that’s the guy<br>bill gates of whatever it’s like the scene lost<br>blow up<br>yeah yeah we’re gonna<br>we’re there’s gonna be something within our lifetime<br>that’s gonna be so<br>mind blowing that it’s gonna change everything<br>you know and you like<br>we were talking about this google thing<br>google buzz that you know was talking about how Twitter<br>like I was hoping Twitter was gonna be it right<br>but like<br>what I didn’t even know about Twitter two years ago<br>I didn’t know about Twitter I never even heard of it<br>what’s funny is I knew about Twitter for a while<br>and I would use it<br>but then I was not that good<br>then something everyone started using it<br>same just caught the fuck on<br>I think also people realize it’s better to make people<br>give them a limited amount of characters to choose<br>well that’s what this google bud<br>that’s what’s with this google buds it takes away that<br>it does yeah and it’s like it’s like how<br>long can you type for I don’t think there is a<br>I don’t know but<br>here’s the difference between for the most part like<br>entertaining videos but people post online<br>like if someone’s like check out<br>someone’s like and that’s somebody I know<br>it’s like and I look<br>and it’s the time post starts getting up there like<br>it’s about his 8min shore<br>I don’t want to watch this right<br>yeah make it short<br>this is more like this is more like a Facebook<br>adding facebook’s status updates I guess to<br>like mix with Twitter<br>people are gonna write fucking novels in this shit man<br>yeah that is a problem<br>man people fuck goddamn for boats<br>I get emails for people with no paragraphs just these<br>floods of information<br>that they just love to hear theirselves talk<br>what the shitty thing though is<br>it takes their<br>email address and takes all your contacts and makes it<br>your friends and stuff like that<br>so what sucks is if you have your<br>you know of course this only works on some people<br>but if you have a girlfriend<br>and then you have your mistress<br>and you have your mistress mom that will bang in also<br>and then you have all these three people that are now<br>friends and reading each other’s Twitter<br>Facebook pages<br>and it just automatically does that too<br>right when you sign up<br>it’s like automatic<br>well this is one of the things<br>we talked about a long time ago is<br>that we’re getting to a point where there will<br>be no more secrets<br>or it’s going to be impossible I mean the convergence<br>of information<br>from your life to my life<br>and all the things that you know<br>and all the things that I know<br>all things I’ve seen you’ve seen<br>we’re going to share those eventually<br>those things are all going to come together<br>and there’s not going to be any secrets<br>we’re going to get to a point<br>in the not so distant future<br>where people are<br>literally going to be able to reach those minds<br>and it’s going to be great<br>I think that we’re getting to some strange time<br>right now in our society in our culture<br>in our species<br>we’re getting to some strange time<br>we’re just dabbling in the edges of<br>some new crazy great thing<br>that’s going to change everything<br>I mean don’t you feel like that when you see the news<br>you hear about shit they’re doing<br>like with a large hydrant collider<br>or you think what all the scientific experiments going<br>on all the shit they’re doing with harp and<br>don’t you feel like I always feel like we’re at<br>kind of like at that fork where we’re either<br>we’re about to like experience<br>something great<br>or like there’s impending doom and like<br>some awful systems<br>I mean people have always<br>felt like that too because we’re so dumb<br>we will occasionally fuck up and<br>shatter everything<br>you know I mean look at what happened in world war ii<br>look at the fact that we really did<br>drop atomic bombs on people<br>yeah I mean that’s so nonspecific<br>I mean we hit entire cities<br>I mean we weren’t trying to just go after the military<br>we drop<br>giant weapons of atomic destruction on entire cities<br>I mean that’s putting incredible inspiration<br>it was like 9 11 for them and for like Hawaii<br>when they drop bombs on Hawaii that was like 9 11<br>70 years ago that’s not<br>I mean most times we talk about that’s nothing great<br>you talk you know<br>hundred two years ago yeah civil war and chefs<br>yeah really racist 70 years ago ain’t shit man<br>that’s crazy you know<br>do you imagine<br>twitters and what it came to wearing back then<br>of all that<br>you know what I really interested is when you look into<br>history and not so distant history<br>like look into like the 19 sixties<br>and you see some of the shit that they were planning<br>like operation northwards<br>you know if you ever read that operation northwood<br>they were going to make<br>fake attacks on american civilians<br>and they’re going to attack quantanamo bay<br>and tell people it was the cubans<br>and so that we get everybody fired up<br>the world with cuba<br>yeah<br>freedom of information act it’s operation northwoods<br>that sounds really interesting<br>it’s got to be bucks that’s crazy oh yeah<br>it’s definitely exciting<br>it was just released recently because<br>the freedom information act yeah<br>it’s like<br>you know like what they were able to do back then<br>in the fifties and the sixties<br>like in the fifties<br>the government did a thing called operation<br>midnight climax<br>where they opened up brothels<br>and they dosed people with lsd that johns<br>these dudes would go there to fuck these hookers<br>they would go to these houses<br>they were run<br>by the fucking cia in New York in San Francisco<br>and they would<br>doubt these guys with acid<br>and then just like study them and take notes<br>these guys were on acid in a whorehouse<br>they just went after work to get their dick socked and<br>they went on a 12h trip of death and destruction<br>why are you fucking with that guy<br>this is one thing incredible<br>and this is something<br>that was like a real experiment for cia ran<br>people send you some people send me things<br>I learned about some stuff on Twitter<br>people send me some good show on Twitter<br>I learned about some stuff from my message board<br>learn about some stuff from interesting friends that<br>you know read an interesting article<br>and they’re like dude you have to check this out<br>this you know<br>this guy made a fucking<br>artificial finger and reattached to him<br>there’s always something nutty that some<br>guys figuring out or some study that people are doing<br>you know<br>it’s amazing how much shit is out there if you really<br>start looking<br>please tell me something interesting<br>go to my board<br>you guys see this dog fuck this chicken<br>yeah you guys see the puppy<br>puppy grabs his chicken drags it into<br>his doghouse and so I was fucking the shit out of it<br>and the chickens are like are you

outstanding what about brian put it up<br>brian’s gonna put it up and I’ll retweet it<br>it’s like a little little<br>could be a lab who knows one of this<br>what is it a little white dog<br>yeah it’s like a little<br>could be a beagle<br>no yeah looks like<br>jack brussel or rare maybe I don’t know<br>who knows it’s a puppy<br>it’s hard to tell what the hell they are<br>when they’re puppies<br>it’s a cheap little fellow though I’ll tell you that<br>she fell fucking the chicken<br>you know like that’s what nature is really all about<br>is another video that I put on my Twitter recently<br>it was a wall or sucking his own dick<br>that’s cool<br>it was outstanding man I hear they will crush<br>their own young if they see some pussy they want<br>like on the other side of the beach<br>really yeah like if<br>their own young can be in the way they will trample<br>and crush them oh we get late<br>that’s how hard<br>it has to find pussy in the walrus world<br>yeah man<br>think about that you’re willing to kill your baby for<br>something that looks like walrus yeah<br>it looks exactly the wallace was sucking his own deck<br>it was ridiculous<br>his dick looked like dave chappelle’s leg<br>it<br>was like this long<br>he’s<br>and his walrus is just deep throughout his own cock<br>I put that on my Twitter as well<br>it’s pretty fascinating man<br>all right I just posted the video<br>the dog fucking a chicken on my Twitter<br>I think I put it up last<br>night so I don’t know if I should retweet it<br>shut is that what is the rule on that<br>I think there’s ants in my butt orica<br>I could feel either that or just have an itch<br>it could be holy coffee cup has ants over<br>wow I got an ant problem here brian<br>all right<br>I’m not gonna retweet that you can find that shit well<br>it was just for brian and I know what<br>it has been messing with me all they’re up there<br>I got an aunt problem<br>motherfuckers you know what it is<br>it rains when it rains in la they all come<br>trying to find dry ground<br>and then all the ants of their outside<br>eaten dead birds and shit<br>now they’re inside<br>little motherfucker spray raid around or whatever<br>I will tonight<br>it’s amazing how it answer like these<br>little monsters that live in your world<br>and you allow them to live in your world<br>because they’re tiny<br>you know because of ants were big<br>we would have fucking gigantic problems<br>could you imagine the ants were like the size of<br>rag rats<br>imagine if they were that big<br>you know how terrifying that would be<br>ants would rip your arms off if they were that big<br>advanced with size of rats they’re so strong they<br>would mangle you<br>they would<br>drag you to the top of a tree and drop you off<br>we would all be dead we would all be dead<br>and they’re just<br>that’s just<br>you know a few thousand times bigger than they are<br>we just<br>deal with the fact that they’re in our little world<br>in these colonies<br>where<br>we don’t even know how to communicate with each other<br>and they all follow in a fucking straight line<br>back to the hive<br>and they got a queen in there<br>and there’s larva and eggs and that little<br>fucking cunt she’s shitting out<br>new baby ants constantly while we’re here talking<br>somewhere in my house<br>somewhere in my house I have to find out where it is<br>probably<br>and there’s something going on here somewhere under<br>plates somewhere<br>I<br>can handle how much hundreds of times their body weight<br>yeah hundreds of times they’re monsters<br>if ants were like<br>full size like this is like size of a human or a<br>dog or something like<br>that they would literally like a scene from the alien<br>they would rip people apart and eat you live<br>they would have no problem killing you<br>I mean there are heartless emotionless monsters<br>you know these have to be little monsters<br>but so are most animals<br>you know most animals are<br>I mean you ever seen like<br>shit chimps will do to each other<br>you know you see shit that dogs will do to each other<br>or you know<br>animals cannibalizing on each other<br>this shit happens all the time the animal chimps rip<br>rip other chimps apartment kill the limbs out<br>got to eat them<br>and they will if you like chips chips<br>campbellize their babies too<br>sometimes are they their babies<br>yeah I know they’ll peel<br>they will peel chunks<br>of skin off of you like it’s fucking bacon strips<br>man yeah they’re so strong they’ll mangle you<br>you’re like an old sheet to them<br>there was<br>a chimp recently<br>a bonobo<br>bonobles were supposed to be the really peaceful ones<br>they got a video footage or a bonobo female<br>cannibalizing her dead baby<br>her baby died she just started eating it<br>you know<br>that’s dark dude yeah<br>that’s dark that’s bloopy shit<br>all right let’s take some questions here<br>I think we’re already over the 2h mark<br>yeah we’re right<br>how do you do it<br>we two and a half hours grow it’s so fascinating<br>such a good talk here and it’s 589 people<br>we’re up to seven eight<br>here’s a good question this guy asks<br>nick tkb 2000<br>what do you think about hollis gracie getting fed up<br>hollis gracie is<br>the great gracie<br>the greatest gracie ever<br>supposedly this got hollis gracie who was like the guy<br>was one of hickson’s original training partners<br>his son just entered the ufc and lost this weekend<br>and everybody’s like<br>real down on the guy because he<br>didn’t have a very good performance<br>and his<br>fight you know<br>he got he got kind of beat up<br>and everybody expected more from him<br>but it ain’t easy man<br>it’s not an easy fucking sport<br>you go in there<br>there’s tremendous amount of pressure on these guys<br>and it’s hard for people to deal with<br>you know and some people that they need to be<br>you know they need to have some bad<br>bad experiences so that they learn from it<br>and then you know<br>either bounce back<br>or realize this isn’t what I want to do<br>you know but some people<br>that they just<br>don’t realize they are the magnitude of the event<br>till they actually<br>get there till they’re under the bright lights<br>and they’re actually<br>fight the guy and they’re like holy shit<br>like what did I get myself into<br>that’s gonna be so crazy<br>yeah the adrenaline dump is tremendous you know<br>he’s so nervous and so much adrenaline pumps out and<br>that’s why gallic randicoteuro<br>such incredible endurance<br>one of the reasons besides the fact<br>that he trained so hard is that the dude is so relaxed<br>he’s been there so many times<br>when he gets in there he’s not freaking out<br>dumb question cannabis<br>equals weed yes yes cannabis equals weed<br>yeah you know the funny thing<br>when marijuana was made illegal<br>people think most people don’t even know this<br>the congress didn’t even know they were making<br>marijuana illegal<br>or they didn’t know they were making cannabis illegal<br>rather cannabis was like a hemp was<br>used it for fiber<br>they used it to make clothes and all kinds of different<br>things and when<br>it was made illegal it’s because<br>they started printing in the paper stories<br>saying that<br>blacks and mexicans were smoking his new drug<br>and they were raping white women<br>and that’s what got people into<br>that’s how gut people behind the whole anti<br>marijuana movement<br>that’s where reefer madness all that shit came from<br>so I have those posters up on my wall<br>I’ve got all those videos reefer manic<br>they’re goddamn hilarious<br>they’re amazing if you haven’t seen them<br>you guys see what kind of shit they put out<br>and they put it out just because<br>they wanted to make sure that people didn’t<br>it’s like there’s a lot of bad things that can happen<br>if you’re in control and people get a hold of pot<br>and you know there’s good things to keeping it illegal<br>you know<br>you can make much more money with pharmaceutical drugs<br>you can sell people<br>what you want to sell you can control those drugs and<br>you know you can’t control shit<br>if<br>marijuana becomes legal it’s something anybody can grow<br>it’s like real easy to grow<br>I’ve met idiots that grow bead<br>you know yeah it’s not hard<br>you know you can figure it out<br>people can’t get their life together at all<br>they can grow some weed<br>it’s just economics<br>that’s the real reason why marijuana is illegal<br>but blacks and mexicans will rate<br>white women if they do<br>smug white cops will rate by blown too<br>oh yeah but not this<br>same thing grow<br>reefer madness rocks I agree young man<br>it was also the paper company yes newspapers<br>yeah they was william randolph hurst<br>william randoff hurst owned the newspaper companies<br>he owned<br>you know hurst publications but he also earned owned<br>printing rather paper mills<br>and so he had like forest filled the trees<br>when they were wanted to convert everything<br>over to hemp paper<br>because hemp makes a much better paper<br>he did not want to do that<br>it would cost him millions of dollars<br>to fucked up his whole business<br>he would have to<br>chop all his trees down and start planting hemp<br>and then he’d be in competition with all these other<br>people that are making a paper<br>it was a economic decision<br>so when he was getting people<br>to<br>ban marijuana they didn’t even know they were banning<br>hemp this industrial<br>plant that they<br>had been using for hundreds and thousands years<br>it’s really kind of fascinating that<br>the propaganda that that guy created in<br>the 19 thirties when he owned all the newspapers<br>is really still in place today<br>I mean people still believe it today<br>it’s pretty brilliant business strategy too right<br>he was a motherfucker man<br>I mean that was<br>the guy that orson welles made that movie<br>rosebud about<br>no it was a movie citizen came<br>isn’t it is that used though<br>howard hughes<br>I thought it was william minor first<br>but yeah yeah yeah it’s hurst yeah so hurst is the one<br>yeah that’s the guy<br>I mean he was just like the guy<br>he was<br>like the first motherfucker that controlled everything<br>yeah<br>that is really fascinating<br>now that it was a paper because I got<br>yeah<br>I mean it doesn’t really amazing<br>bro you can chew it up with hands<br>I think you can relax fella<br>settle down<br>it was girls right now they’re yelling at you<br>girls are telling you suck it up it’s just an ant<br>you have ants in your asshole<br>oh damn dude so they said to you<br>mmm
