whole team<br>I was plotted in chains but there is a shadowy schemes<br>the baddest scene the more lies you tell<br>the more lies you telling about surprising<br>failing to my deaf trap right into my clutches<br>stupid you notice how much<br>blessed every single mikey touches I suffered<br>so I could return harder<br>what I needed<br>fuck around make you a martyr I’ll make you famous<br>turn around and make your aimless cause you never<br>understood our vital to me<br>this rap game is<br>save it and hold that you catch a hot one<br>drive the chase a fake nigga down<br>soon as I pop one clip<br>when you wanna mess with it<br>a nice life<br>in this business around<br>hmm<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>I’m here<br>but I got no video<br>just whack ass shit<br>it just it never ends<br>I can’t get it right<br>you can hear me<br>but you can’t see me<br>ladies and gentlemen I do not know<br>how the fuck this program works<br>that’s supposed to get me on<br>and I don’t know why it’s not showing<br>try this<br>we got it<br>we’re in<br>so I’m playing gang star at a respect<br>for guru from gang star had a<br>heart attack this week he went into a coma<br>he’s in like some sort of a medically induced coma<br>some dude said it best on Twitter said that’s<br>when you know you’re getting old<br>when hip hop stars start having fucking heart attacks<br>man he’s 40 three’s only year older than me<br>we’re gonna do later gentlemen<br>we’re all dying slowly<br>not this motherfucker<br>look at this dude from national geographic magazine<br>I just picked this up<br>I don’t even know the story<br>but I just had to pick it up because it’s hilarious<br>it’s about polygamy it says polygamy in america<br>and it’s one dude who’s got five wives<br>and 46 children<br>now<br>my only problem<br>with any<br>of this shit is that these creepy fucks are always<br>marrying 16 year olds<br>that’s why I don’t tell you about it<br>and when you go into the article that’s actually<br>a big a big point<br>here that a couple of these guys have been arrested<br>like this fucking freak<br>telling that guy you came to see but<br>that looks like somebody should just arrest<br>he was apparently<br>married to some 16 year olds who’s<br>they sent some to 10 years in<br>present for sexual assault<br>this is the only problem with these creepy fucks<br>with this crazy<br>five wive shit<br>the only way you get chicks to agree to that<br>is if they’re drugged up<br>or tarted or really<br>really young<br>and that’s how these guys pull the shit off<br>that’s not fair<br>you know I’m saying I mean if you’re pulling it off<br>total pimp style<br>like if you just some hugh hefner type character<br>that like lays down the law and it’s like listen<br>I’m gonna have a bunch of chicks and it’s all<br>this guy’s like<br>he’s like getting him when they’re really<br>young and brainwashing him<br>so it really is like a cult<br>just believe me chicks don’t want that shit but hey<br>if you could pull it off when you’re an adult<br>whatever I’m not a hater<br>I’m all for it<br>if you can pull it off as an adult<br>but like I said<br>but these creepy fucks these<br>I don’t know what<br>what this dude’s thing is called<br>I guess it’s a mormon splinter group<br>no whatever no one has any fucking answers<br>any ideology that you follow is gonna be full of shit<br>any one of them all of them unless it’s completely open<br>unless there’s not one single person<br>that’s laying down rules<br>not one single person that’s telling you what to do<br>unless it’s just a gigantic group of people<br>that are all really<br>like minded open minded and thinking about things<br>that’s the No.1 problem with democracy is that<br>fucking anybody can vote<br>and<br>you can easily<br>get people to think the way you’re thinking<br>it’s not that difficult<br>most people have no idea how to think<br>and on top of that they have to fucking work<br>and they have a family<br>and they have obligations and they have<br>debt and they have problems and they try to get laid<br>there’s a lot of shit going on<br>so for them to be paying attention to<br>what’s really going on with the national deficit<br>and all that crap<br>it’s not gonna happen man it’s too much to think about<br>even the fucking people that work in finance don’t<br>understand finance<br>if they did<br>how did that bernie made off thing ever get off<br>how did that guy ever pull that shit off<br>he pulled that shit off because<br>no one understands the system<br>it’s nuts that system is<br>they’re just fucking fucking ears<br>those guys are just pirates<br>stealing money left and right<br>and that’s how our world works ladies and gentlemen<br>so since I did this podcast last<br>killer whale killed his trainer and he saw<br>people follow me on Twitter<br>I posted a lot of shit about that on Twitter<br>because I thought it was completely fucking ridiculous<br>that they first of all<br>they take these animals that are super intelligent<br>and they caged them<br>you know the way this whale was raised<br>this whale particular was raised in Canada<br>and the place where they had him<br>would they would give him<br>this little tiny cell<br>to share with<br>these other whales at night<br>so they would like<br>stuff them into this thing<br>where they literally couldn’t turn around<br>they couldn’t move they couldn’t do anything<br>and if he didn’t go into his cage<br>and if he didn’t do his tricks they would<br>they would deprive him of food<br>up to 25 to 30% of his daily<br>food intake they would just cut it back from him<br>so this poor animal was<br>as intelligent as us<br>was forced to star<br>forced to do tricks to get his food and forced to<br>willingly enter into a cage in order to get his food<br>so this is a fucking angry animal<br>not on top of that they don’t really let him breed<br>they excite him<br>and then they extract sperm from them<br>like they basically jerk them off<br>you know and they sell his sperm<br>because it’s worth a lot of money<br>they’re trying to<br>breed whales and captivity because people<br>find it very distasteful<br>when you go and capture killer whales<br>now because we know how smart they are<br>we know how tied they are to their family<br>this whale was stolen from his family when he was<br>2 years old they’re supposedly as close to<br>human beings as you can get<br>but being totally alien from us<br>I mean they don’t alter their environment<br>they don’t<br>you know they can’t change their surroundings<br>they don’t have you know anything<br>they could pick shit up<br>but they have dialects<br>they have different<br>sounds you know for different packs of whales<br>so they understand each other and<br>they different pods of whales<br>so they they understand each other’s dialect<br>they mate and<br>they stay together like they stay with their family<br>like for life<br>like this whale would have been with his mom<br>for life and they just fucking snatched him<br>out of the water when he was 2 years old<br>I mean the whole thing is so creepy<br>it’s basically slavery<br>it’s slavery but we allow it because we don’t<br>understand them<br>I mean that’s really what it is<br>I mean those fucking animals are super intelligent<br>you know I read that their cerebral cortex is<br>40% larger than ours<br>you know<br>they’re lacking some things that we have and they have<br>you know more of other things that we have<br>but what’s very clear is that they’re super intelligent<br>their intelligence is so difficult to<br>understand though because it’s so alien<br>because their world is so alien I mean they live<br>they are out there just with their mouths<br>they’re super intelligent and they’re killing with<br>their fucking face<br>you know they’re not like removed from it<br>like us where you go to the supermarket<br>and you pick up a stake<br>they are as intelligent as<br>supposedly as humans and they’re<br>they kill with their own head<br>mean that’s a<br>totally different mindset<br>totally different world they live in<br>they have to kill sharks<br>because sharks<br>will occasionally you know attack their pups and<br>you know there’s just just dangerous<br>they don’t like having sharks around<br>there’s a killer<br>there’s a killer video<br>there’s a cool video<br>online of a killer whale killing a great white shark<br>you know<br>they’ve never killed a single human being in the wild<br>ever they only kill human beings and captivity<br>why because those fucking<br>human beings are like prison guards man<br>those are slave masters<br>it’s just like us<br>taking someone and putting them in jail<br>if we don’t understand their language it’s really<br>no different you know<br>I think that<br>killer whales are probably<br>definitely smarter than some people<br>I mean<br>think of like the dumbest fucking people that you know<br>I bet killer whales are probably smart than sarah palin<br>I bet if you had a killer whale had like a contest like<br>some sort of a<br>mental aptitude<br>contest with like a real meathead<br>I bet the killer whale would win you know for sure<br>that’s fucked up man<br>we don’t we don’t ever get our shit together<br>that’s that’s it really drives me nuts<br>it’s like human beings for whatever reason<br>are exactly as we have always been<br>we just don’t get our shit together<br>you know<br>I don’t understand it<br>don’t know what the fuck our problem is<br>it doesn’t seem like we’re ever working anything out<br>just the same<br>shit over and over and over and over again<br>so<br>my friends on Twitter<br>was cracking I will now go to the<br>Twitter little chat thing<br>try to get some questions if this<br>browser doesn’t crash<br>now the way I’m doing it I’m gonna browse with firefox<br>and I’m gonna stream the show with safari<br>like you give a fuck<br>so I guess they just signed james tony to the ufc<br>I guess that’s real<br>that’s awesome man<br>if it’s true I want to see it<br>I want to see some freak shows I want to see<br>I want to see<br>I would love to see james tony<br>versus someone good you know<br>some good a good grappler or not even man<br>maybe<br>someone who’s good will stand up with him a little bit<br>maybe a good like you know what I would love to see<br>james tony vs pat berry<br>you know james tony with those four ounce gloves<br>people don’t realize how good that guy’s hands are<br>he’s gonna show people a whole different level<br>if someone will stand with them but that’s the thing<br>somebody doesn’t want to stand with them<br>they’re just gonna take his ass down at will<br>and they’re gonna kick his legs out from under him<br>that’s gonna be the biggest shock<br>I just wonder who he’s gonna train with<br>I wonder if he’s gonna really train<br>with kickboxers and what you did to you guys<br>and if he’s gonna take<br>leg kicks and learn how to check kicks<br>or side check kicks as he calls it<br>you know<br>who knows man<br>who the fuck knows<br>I guess he’s a heavyweight<br>I don’t think he’s gonna lose weight<br>I mean he he is<br>a boxing heavyweight champion<br>I mean he destroyed a holyfield that heavyweight<br>I’m fucking sight for that man<br>I think that’s gonna be fun<br>I think it’s gonna be interesting<br>but like I said I want to see jose<br>conseco versus hershel walker I’m a freak<br>I want to see the freak shows<br>my Twitter people<br>my<br>my friends<br>get some of these<br>christian group wants killer whale stone to death<br>is that true that’s interesting<br>you might have just made that shit up you fuck<br>jerry vet I don’t know is that true<br>change tony versus herschel walker<br>I don’t know man<br>I don’t know if that’s a good move<br>I think that would be a little dangerous<br>I think cursely needs a few more fights before<br>he steps in there with a guy who can bang like<br>james tony<br>unless hershes got a really good take down defense<br>I don’t know or it really get take downs rather<br>very possible<br>so many questions are really terrible<br>world strongest man to fight in the ufc<br>that pujinaski guy<br>I think<br>they’re talking about pujinaski fighting james tony<br>which I think is very interesting<br>because<br>not james telling<br>excuse me<br>they’re talking about pujinaski fighting tim sylvia<br>which I think is very interesting because<br>gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt<br>gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt<br>gt gt gt gt gt gt<br>gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt super strong<br>and everything is a beast of a man<br>but god damn I mean how much of people people<br>selling tim sylvia short<br>yeah ray mercer knocked him out with a big punch<br>but guess what<br>ray merch<br>would knock out almost anybody with that fucking punch<br>so ray mercy hits you in the jaw like that<br>there’s not a whole lot of people<br>that I could imagine outside of mark hunt in his prime<br>taking that punch on that chen you know<br>I think people are selling<br>people are selling tim sylvia very short<br>dude’s good man<br>he’s very good<br>this guy says<br>james tony isn’t dedicated to anything but food<br>that’s not true sir how dare you<br>it couldn’t be because<br>you can’t get that good<br>and it’s impossible<br>it’s impossible to get that good and not be<br>training all the time it’s not possible<br>for sure he’s<br>you know for sure he’s got killer boxing technique<br>his ability to<br>shoulder roll punches<br>and ability to block punches and counter<br>like he’s one of those dudes<br>you can stay right outside and just land counters<br>I’m interested in seeing what happens when I got like<br>that punches somebody with those little gloves on<br>and who knows I mean he might break his fucking hands<br>I mean that’s possible too<br>you know<br>I don’t think he’s had hand problems in the past but<br>I’m curious to see like<br>I wonder what<br>would happen with a guy like fully mayweather who has<br>had hand problems<br>those little gloves<br>they don’t offer that much protection<br>and if you catch a guy on the elbow<br>or you catch a guy like<br>top of his head or something like that or<br>you just hit him<br>hit him the wrong way<br>you can break your hand very very possible<br>but I think it’s interesting man I’m thinking<br>you know all these crazy fights<br>the hershel walker thing with jose guziko<br>this james tony thing<br>all these crazy fights<br>what they do is they get more people thinking about<br>mix martial arts<br>and the more people think about mix martial arts<br>the more they’re gonna watch the real fighters<br>not that these guys are not real fighters but<br>the real high level fighters<br>you know the machidas and the anderson silvas and<br>and came the last guy as those kind of guys<br>so I think it’s all good<br>it’s all good<br>coming to Canada this week you dirty bitches<br>I’m coming to<br>halfax I’m coming to Ottawa and I’m coming to<br>Toronto<br>where I’ve never been and I’m very excited because<br>I’ve wanted to go to Toronto for a long ass time<br>and trying to make it happen<br>forever and for whatever reason<br>I just couldn’t pull it off<br>couldn’t pull it off<br>but now I got it together<br>so<br>tomorrow I’m at the<br>casino nova scotia in Halifax<br>and then Friday I’m at the bronson<br>theater or the bronson center<br>in Ottawa<br>and then Saturday I’m at the queen elizabeth theater<br>in Toronto and I think<br>I think nova scotia<br>the casino nova scotia and Halifax is almost sold out<br>and<br>Saturday night is sold out<br>the Toronto thing is sold out<br>I believe<br>so<br>I’ll see you my friends we’re gonna have a good time<br>I just got back from Dallas which is a crazy ass town<br>Dallas people are nuts<br>that place is<br>a lot of fun Texas is a lot of fun in general<br>just people love the party in Texas man<br>the shows I have in Texas just always<br>seem to be like a little extra rowdy<br>little extra crazy<br>just fun ass fucking state<br>that’s why I’m gonna go in the apocalypse hits<br>that’s my next move<br>my next move is Texas soon as<br>San Francisco breaks off and falls into the ocean<br>I’m gonna take the hint<br>pack up my shit<br>move to Texas<br>that’s where you want to be<br>if al qaeda attacks america too<br>al qaeda is like 100 al qaeda right<br>one of the crazy things they said about afghanistan<br>there’s like 100 taliban in afghanistan<br>I don’t know if it’s right<br>I don’t know if it’s true<br>the fucking world’s filled with lies<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>I don’t understand any of it needed you<br>why we playing games<br>why do we pretend that we understand the news and with<br>all the bullshit the government feeds us to even<br>pretend that<br>we know exactly what’s happening overseas is<br>laughable that shit’s ridiculous<br>there’s no way you can know what’s going<br>on in afghanistan<br>when I hear people arguing<br>you know well<br>you knew what<br>man the taliban right now and the position that<br>allocate is saying it’s imperative that wheat<br>what are you even fucking talking about dude<br>I know that you have a kid<br>I know that you’re a fucking accountant<br>I know that you play softball<br>that’s a lot of time that you just ate up<br>where is the time to going<br>to afghanistan and really<br>finding out what the fuck is going on with the taliban<br>it’s not happening right<br>you’re just talking out of your ass<br>that’s what everybody’s doing<br>they’re reading talking points based on<br>you know the various<br>right wing or left wing websites or right wing<br>or left wing television shows they’re picking aside<br>and they just fucking get on it<br>and that’s the problem with human beings<br>we you know all this<br>nutty shit happens in the world<br>and one of the reasons why<br>we allow nutty shit to happen<br>is because we get on a team<br>you know we got a team and we pick it<br>that’s why so few democrats are complaining about obama<br>democrats should be going fucking bonkers<br>just like everybody else is going bonkers<br>because obama’s proven to be<br>no different than any of the rest of them<br>but democrats<br>they’re not saying any crazy shit about obama because<br>obama is on their team<br>and that’s how people look at shit<br>and that’s why we’re so fucked up<br>you know I mean this guy<br>he sends he gets the nobel peace prize and then<br>sends 30,000 troops to afghanistan would<br>you imagine how democrats would react<br>if a republican did that<br>they would go fucking crazy<br>meanwhile with obama they’re like uh<br>well<br>they don’t want to say anything<br>I mean it’s really the perfect way<br>to get if the republicans were a genius<br>I mean if the if the big<br>cabal conspiracy is true<br>if there are<br>billionaire bankers that totally control the world<br>what a genius way to control everything<br>you get a black liberal<br>and you have him do exactly the same thing<br>that republicans do<br>get a black liberal<br>a guy who’s supposedly liberal but yet is<br>sending means liberal in the way he spends tax dollars<br>fucking all this crazy shit with the bail out that<br>the fact that they’re not accountable for this money<br>we can’t exactly figure out where it all went<br>and they haven’t loosened lending at all<br>that was a whole idea about this<br>it was supposed to stimulate the economy and<br>make that money more accessible but<br>they’ve low less money than ever before<br>I mean the whole thing is it’s just reeks of crime<br>it reeks of corruption and opportunism<br>yet you know how many democrats are talking about it<br>very few the reason why is because he’s on their team<br>it makes no sense<br>it’s like a guy<br>on a football team<br>throwing the fucking ball the wrong way<br>and the crowd is still cheering<br>I mean it’s really what it’s like<br>or the crowd’s not saying anything<br>they’re pretending they don’t know<br>we love to be on fucking teams<br>it’s one of the worst things about human beings<br>and one of the scariest teams right now is team stupid<br>it’s not even team republican<br>team stupid jumps on team republican<br>because team republican doesn’t talk down to them<br>but that’s why the serapelan thing works so well<br>the reason why serapelan works so well is<br>not because all these people believe<br>with her ideas and<br>they agree with her ideas and<br>agree with her on the issues<br>they don’t even know how she stands on the issues<br>one of the scariest videos I ever saw in line was as<br>dude at a serapeland book signing<br>these motherfuckers were in line for hours<br>it was like zero degrees outside<br>they’re in line for hours waiting<br>to talk to sarah palin<br>talking about how she should be president<br>and about you know they’re just<br>bringing back to<br>basic values and<br>going to go back to the way america should be<br>and<br>all that talk is just stupid talk<br>that’s what they are<br>what they’re saying is she seems like me I am dumb<br>I don’t know what the fuck is happening I’m terrified<br>I believe in fairy tales<br>I believe in dumb nonsense that’s easily disproven<br>and I like her because she does too<br>they like the fact that sarah palin believes<br>that evolution is bullshit<br>and that the earth is only 10,000 years old<br>she believes that she said that<br>to a fucking teacher in Alaska<br>she had a conversation with them<br>you know but what long before she ever ran for<br>president or a wife president rather<br>that’s what they like<br>they look stupid<br>people love stupid shit<br>they love someone<br>that makes them feel like they’re okay<br>if you use a windows computer<br>you love other people that use windows<br>you use windows too<br>yeah windows rules maxia for fags<br>or it’s the other way<br>if you’re a mac head<br>you’re like those idiots and their fucking windows<br>people<br>love to be on the same team whether it’s republican<br>or democrat or smart or stupid<br>how many dumb people<br>have you ever met that are on team smart<br>a lot right there are a lot of dumb people<br>that try to pretend to be smart<br>and then you talk to above things<br>and they just have like<br>these talking points that they can repeat but<br>they really have just adopted a conglomeration<br>of other people’s opinions<br>they haven’t really thought anything out<br>and when you challenge them on the very ideas<br>for these opinions that are<br>they’re organizing and governing their entire lives<br>they really have nothing to say about it<br>because they haven’t really thought about it<br>that’s a smart person<br>according to most people<br>that’s that’s someone who’s on team smart<br>but he’s really a dumb god<br>and that’s very common<br>it’s just taking advantage of the whole team thing<br>and that’s what the fuck is going on with obama<br>we got a we got a guys pretending<br>to be on<br>you know one team and doing exactly the same thing<br>that the other team would do<br>this guy says<br>dustin hunter says I didn’t use to hate mccain<br>until he brought palin into the picture<br>I think<br>what sarah palin should show any<br>all of us all of us is that<br>it clearly she’s not qualified to run the world<br>there’s no way no but nobody believes that<br>but what that shows you is that<br>the position of president really is just horseshit<br>you know they really are just a spokesperson<br>you know you get into that position<br>you’re a spokesperson for big business<br>it’s no more than being a star of a sitcom<br>you know you’re not writing the sitcom<br>you’re the star of the sitcom<br>you’re the guy that they choose<br>to play<br>the fat poster worker<br>or whatever the fuck you are the bartender<br>whatever whatever you want<br>you know<br>you’re you’re the the black liberal you know<br>you’re the white rancher I mean<br>george bush<br>even what so far is to buy a fucking ranch in Texas<br>you know I mean that kind of<br>it’s from fucking Maine you know<br>they displayed this part of like the Texas<br>down home<br>he’s out in the memory used to be on the ranch like<br>sawing wooden shit<br>like what the fuck are you doing man<br>sawing wood you know<br>supposed to think that<br>you’re on my side now it’s like they’re playing a part<br>you know and that’s what’s going on so mccain I mean<br>he’s no different than all the rest of them you know<br>if you were really a maverick<br>you never get to that position<br>the guys like ron paul<br>the guys that stand up<br>and I mean ron paul just gave back<br>$100,000 to the treasury<br>from his I guess from<br>I don’t know exactly but the details of it<br>I have to read it sounds really good good talking point<br>but ron paul is like<br>he’s like this old dude that wears sneakers<br>you know he wears suits with sneakers on you know why<br>because he doesn’t give a fuck<br>you know he doesn’t care they’re black<br>they’re so they’re the leather and the bottoms rubber<br>they’re more comfortable<br>than fucking stupid shoes with slippery souls<br>you know I mean<br>that’s the kind of duty is<br>he’s just just don’t give a fuck dude and<br>those dudes don’t get to be president<br>those dudes just get to talk a lot<br>and somewhere someone along the line<br>figures out some way to discredit him<br>make him look nutty<br>you know you remember when he was a talking<br>when all the people were talking about<br>presidential candidates back in 2008<br>you know ron polly<br>there were joking about him<br>laughing about him left and right<br>meanwhile everything he said came true<br>when he was talking about the economic collapse when<br>he was talking about<br>I mean everything that he said about the bailout<br>everything he said about where the money was gonna go<br>he’s fucking right<br>I want all this shit and they still<br>make it seem like he’s a nut and you know<br>somehow another manage to connect him to 9 11 truthers<br>and you know<br>fucking davidi<br>graptillion conspiracy theorists<br>like all these fucking nutty people<br>they somehow another<br>wand up connecting them all together to<br>somehow another discredit anything that might be<br>a little bit controversial or weird<br>you know that’s another thing that people like to do<br>they love to<br>love to box shit up nice and tidy you know<br>and you know<br>if you’re saying some things that<br>are uncomfortable for people to hear<br>they just stick you with some nile 11 truthers or some<br>some along those lines<br>just shut you right the fuck up<br>you know<br>ron paul apparently doesn’t believe in evolution though<br>which is very interesting<br>because that’s<br>you know whether or not you<br>believe that there’s a god<br>or whether or not I mean every everyone think the<br>the two<br>I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive I think that<br>the idea of<br>of evolution is like the idea that everything<br>becomes more and more complex as time goes on<br>and we could see that the evidence of that<br>we could see that in our own lives<br>we could see that in our own culture<br>try watching like a tv show from 1950<br>they were so fucking dumb<br>I mean they were so dumb<br>it’s like staggering they’re like a comedy now<br>it’s almost like they’re a parody<br>you know if you lot watch<br>like father knows best or something like that<br>I mean it really is almost like a parody<br>and the reason being because<br>people did not have as much access to information<br>back then they were more naive<br>our culture was less evolved<br>if you look at the music<br>from 1930 and then look at the music here<br>in 2010 it’s very<br>clear that things are becoming more and more complex<br>they’re evolving<br>sure there’s some dumb shit that’s stuffed in there too<br>and there’s always going to be dumb shit<br>you need to feed the dummies<br>but on the most part<br>like rock music and more complex music<br>it’s just it sounds different<br>the production quality is far better<br>you know what they can do with music and sound<br>it’s far better<br>it’s evolving<br>it’s becoming more complex just like all organisms are<br>you know there’s a place in the Congo<br>where the Congo is only<br>the way it is right now<br>the rainforest<br>has only been like that for a couple thousand years<br>2000 years ago<br>what it was it was grasslands<br>but the grasslands because the climate change<br>became this rainforest and there’s a lot of like<br>plains animals that are stuck inside this<br>this incredibly dense jungle<br>and one of them is this little antelope<br>and this little antelope I think it’s called a dyker<br>it swims underwater and it eats fish<br>it’s in the fucking antelope family<br>it’s this little tiny short legged antelope<br>it swims underwater and eats fish<br>I mean if that’s not something<br>fucking adapting and surviving<br>and this is over<br>the course of just a couple of thousand years<br>here’s a fish<br>in the Congo that climbs out of the water and walks<br>to the next water hole and then dives in<br>I mean what the fuck is that<br>that’s something evolving<br>you know<br>this is evolution that’s occurring in this little small<br>area over a very short period of time<br>I mean the idea that this fucking antelope<br>developed to swim<br>because there’s so much water<br>there and there’s rivers and all the other shit<br>and it’s you know it’s a way to get more food<br>they swim underwater and they eat fish<br>I mean it’s fucking craziness<br>they’ve developed ability<br>to hunt you know and it’s an antelope<br>I mean that’s pretty crazy stuff<br>that doesn’t mean there’s no god<br>it just means there’s some other shit going on<br>you know it doesn’t mean that there’s not<br>some one all powerful thing at the end of it<br>the idea though<br>that that one<br>all powerful thing<br>at the end of it looks like us and talks English<br>and you know is<br>you know it wants you to follow his way<br>or you burn in hell or all that<br>fucking cookiness<br>that’s obviously people fucking with the idea<br>but I think the idea that<br>the whole thing<br>might be operating under some sort of an ethic<br>that the whole universe might be operating<br>under the force of<br>like at least an energy or a direction<br>you know we think of it<br>you know as of god as being a thing<br>but maybe god is everything<br>maybe god is all things<br>and then all things work together<br>but that our job<br>whatever our job is on this earth<br>that we’re moving in a<br>direction where we have to compete<br>in order to facilitate that movement<br>and<br>in order to really be in competition with each other<br>we have to sort of think separate from each other<br>we have to compete with each other<br>so there has to be a you and there has to be a me<br>there has to be separation to compete sexually<br>there has to be separation to compete financially<br>to compete you know career wise<br>and that<br>maybe<br>all a byproduct of<br>the law of nature<br>that it might be moving us in this direction<br>and that might be one of the reasons<br>why people are slowly starting to<br>become aware of that idea<br>they mean the idea that<br>all human beings and all everything<br>in this whole universe are somehow connected<br>you know I mean that might be really what’s<br>what’s going on<br>but we might be unaware of that because our job is on<br>this planet in this life<br>in this dimension<br>our job is to facilitate something<br>our job is to compete with each other in order to<br>facilitate our cultural evolution<br>because<br>if we didn’t have that if we didn’t think like that<br>you know if we lived like monks or if we<br>you know lived like native americans<br>we wouldn’t you know technology would get done<br>you know theoretically<br>at this point time who knows<br>you know at this point time maybe you<br>I’m hiding the chat rogan fans are batshit insane<br>really<br>are they that bad it’s going on over here<br>let’s see<br>this ushim slow as fuck<br>this guy says are you as high as me<br>I don’t know how high you are buddy<br>I don’t answer trick questions<br>how dare you<br>so<br>here we go<br>oh ron paul hates blacks<br>are you sure<br>denis cushionage is the ron paula the left yeah<br>that he seems to be another one<br>you never know what these denis cusinage guys are<br>you know I think ron paul’s<br>pretty obviously legit<br>but you never know how many<br>these guys just decide that<br>there’s a lot of money and being a rebel<br>you know it’s very possible<br>it’s very possible that you know they’re just<br>fucking playing us<br>and that<br>they know they can get a good movement going on<br>sort of like gurus<br>you know<br>if you ever met anybody that proclaims to be like<br>really like<br>open minded and all about<br>love but really<br>turns out they’re kind of all about themselves<br>and they’re kind of like full of shit<br>like they’re really not on a quest<br>they’re just all about like fulfilling their ego<br>you know and that this<br>that stance the loving you know open<br>I’m a buddhist<br>I’ve been practicing buddhism for a while<br>and then you know you really get to know the guy<br>get him drop and he’s a douche bag<br>you know<br>what is that you know<br>I think I think there’s a lot of people to doing that<br>I think that could be like the denis kushnage thing to<br>who knows I mean he might be legit<br>I’m not saying dennis kushinage in general<br>I’m saying it’s very possible<br>now not saying dennis consumes specifically<br>but it’s very possible<br>that especially in today’s day and age<br>that someone could<br>posture themselves position themselves<br>as like the outsider<br>position themselves as the rebel<br>someone is outside the system’s gonna take it down<br>you know<br>look at all this corruption look at all this chaos<br>what we need to do is this<br>I’m willing to give up all my money<br>I’ll work for free and<br>you know<br>and build some kind of a crazy movement behind them<br>I mean it’s really not a bad idea<br>somebody disenfranchised people<br>right<br>my friends you know what the fuck I’m talking about<br>yeah they found tons of water in the moon<br>I would think that would be really interesting<br>if I hadn’t seen sunshine last night<br>right now I don’t give a fuck about space<br>I saw a stupid science fiction movie last night<br>that was really good for like<br>3&#x2F;4 of it it was a fascinating movie<br>felt like 3&#x2F;4 of the movie and then it just took this<br>left turn down what the fuck boulevard<br>and it was just just retarded the last<br>quarter of it is<br>literally like someone took the script<br>and like got a hold of the last 20 pages and just<br>jacked the whole movie<br>just wanted to make sure that the movie sucked<br>I mean it was really like somebody<br>had a vested interest in the studio failing<br>opening for me tomorrow would be<br>the lovely and talented sam Tripoli<br>you’ve never seen sam before<br>he’s fucking hilarious and he’s<br>old school comic store veteran<br>knowing sam forever<br>and ari had a back out last minute<br>some shit came up he just nailed some nice commercials<br>so ari’s making some loop<br>he had to make that paper and I’m saying<br>so ari had a back out so sam triple he’s in<br>who is hilarious<br>do it so it’s gonna be a<br>fuck of a hell of a lot of good time<br>yeah zombie sunburn man says<br>cheese cow yeah you know what I’m talking about man<br>that movie sucked at the end I didn’t<br>that was ridiculous<br>what would the world<br>be like if everyone could separate from their ego<br>seeing that’s<br>the problem I don’t think it would work<br>you know one of<br>you know<br>the realities of this life is<br>there’s a whole system set up<br>and one person<br>out of 6 billion is not going to change<br>the whole system<br>and the way the system is set up<br>for the majority of human beings is competition<br>and competition sexually competition socially<br>competition financially and that that competition<br>when you have that<br>it fosters innovation<br>it makes sure that people<br>create new things and make sure that people work hard<br>it make sure that people compete with each other<br>and things get done<br>and I wrote a blog about this that I think that that’s<br>what human beings purpose on this earth is<br>I think that our purpose<br>as like materialists this whole idea<br>of competition and capitalism and materialism<br>that it might be really just to support technology<br>that it might be<br>the universe’s way of making us evolve<br>that we might not just evolve physically<br>by you know<br>ourselves becoming more complex our dna becoming more<br>but it might be more complicated than that<br>we might be evolving by integrating with technology<br>we might be evolving by facilitating technology to<br>to emerge and you know<br>I mean it might be as simple as<br>I wrote about my blog about there’s a<br>an aquatic worm that infects grasshoppers and it<br>takes over the grasshopper and<br>makes the grasshopper a zombie<br>like it infects them<br>it’s a parasite gets inside their<br>body grows inside the body cavity the grasshopper<br>then rewires the grasshopper’s brain<br>and forces the grasshopper to jump into water<br>and drown so that it can<br>pop out of the grasshopper’s body and survive<br>if that ain’t some shit<br>I mean that is fucking nuts<br>that’s a really crazy thing to think about<br>that this organism tricks<br>another organism to commit suicide<br>and thus give birth to it<br>because that’s the only<br>way that aquatic worm could live<br>it can’t live in the grasshopper’s world<br>if it comes out in the grasshopper’s world<br>it’ll dry out and it’ll die<br>but if it talks the grasshopper<br>into committing suicide by jumping in the lake<br>grasshoppers can’t swim<br>you know I mean that’s like a<br>a fire bug talking you into diving into a volcano<br>it doesn’t make any sense like it’s certain death<br>if a grasshopper jumps into that water<br>it’s certain death<br>and somehow another<br>this organism talks the grasshopper into doing it<br>you know<br>it might very well be that our purpose as an organism<br>that the human beings purpose<br>in this world<br>is to make something else<br>that our purpose is to create a life form<br>out of technology<br>it’s very possible<br>very very possible<br>if you think about what life is I mean what life is<br>I mean there’s cellular life and there’s<br>you know we assume that that’s what all life is<br>but what life is is something that reproduces<br>something that exists it moves<br>about of its own accord it<br>you know<br>even well plants don’t do that but plants reproduce and<br>there’s a process<br>it takes in energy and puts out energy<br>breeze in oxygen<br>puts out carbon dioxide<br>it’s like<br>that applies to<br>computers that applies to electronics<br>yeah we create them but they require something<br>and they release something<br>you know when you’re playing with a computer<br>you know you turn it on<br>it requires power<br>but then it radiates images and it radiates<br>you know information and connects to other computers<br>I mean there’s a whole process<br>it’s very similar to a life form<br>and if at one point in time<br>if they become sentient that means<br>if they have a mind of their own<br>if they can think for themselves<br>they’re aware they’re alive<br>if they’re aware that you know<br>that they are individuals or<br>if they’re become conscious<br>if that happens<br>who’s to say that’s not a life form<br>I mean if artificial intelligence<br>is more intelligence than us<br>just because it’s artificial<br>just because we created it doesn’t mean it’s not real<br>I mean to call it artificial intelligence<br>it’s not artificial like<br>like you know<br>here’s a fucking ferrari that’s made of cake<br>you can’t drive it<br>no it’s fucking intelligent it’s real intelligent<br>it’s not it’s more synthetic intelligence<br>it’s more man created intelligence<br>but to call it artificial I’m not sure if that’s right<br>I’m not sure if that’s the way to look at it<br>or maybe I just smoked too much weak<br>that’s possible too<br>but you know I don’t think so<br>I’m going with my initial ideas<br>computers will have a soul<br>well that’s the big question what the fuck is a soul<br>I mean<br>that’s a<br>question of what a solar that’s a<br>that’s a slippery but goddamn question right there mean<br>is that real is it so real<br>what is it is a soul energy<br>you know is a soul<br>the same in us as it is in all things<br>I mean what if fucking desk steps souls<br>what if wood has a soul<br>we don’t know<br>I mean I would say that to vegetarian friends<br>you know people would be like oh I don’t eat meat<br>I believe in animal suffering<br>I understand that<br>but you know and I appreciate that I like animals too<br>but what how do we not know that trees suffer<br>if now I talked to daniel pinchbeck is<br>psychedelic author dude he told me that trees can<br>feel pain and that they’ve proven it and that<br>they can detect when people in a room<br>like when someone has done them harm<br>that you could like<br>hook them up to like some sort of a sensor<br>and they can detect when the person who’s done harm<br>like they react when the person’s in the room<br>so how do we not know we’re not torturing trees<br>trees are just some life form that we can’t understand<br>you know I mean it might be just a<br>a less obvious version of us<br>you know being willing to imprisoned dolphins you know<br>maybe keeping a fucking<br>plant and your house sucks for the plant<br>maybe that’s terrible for them<br>you know can you imagine what it feels like to be some<br>shitty plant that everybody forgets to water<br>and you just sit there like half<br>starving the death all the time<br>you know we don’t know<br>that’s that’s a form of life<br>plants are a form of life<br>so whether you eat plants or eat animals man for real<br>I don’t think it’s nearly well<br>I don’t really think that much of a difference<br>don’t eat people because people talk<br>they scream<br>supposedly<br>hmm<br>they did that on mythbusters<br>is that true buddy<br>they did that on mythbusters and they prove that<br>the plants can’t think<br>or they can’t feel you<br>or react because I’m pretty sure<br>that was like scientific data from like a university<br>he was quoting me<br>I don’t know though<br>I will leave it up to you people to google<br>I could google that shit right now but<br>then I’ll be all distracted<br>and I would not be able to keep my flow<br>best vaporizer for like 200 bucks<br>look this is a hilarious question<br>vido caputo do you think fador is a bitch<br>yeah yeah totally yeah it’s just you<br>go tell him go tell him he’s bitch<br>it’s not like knock out<br>or submitted or beating a fuck out of every<br>human being he’s faced<br>yeah what a bitch<br>what<br>in regardless of whether you like the ufc<br>you want to see that match up or or what<br>there’s no way you can call that guy a bitch<br>that guy’s a fucking savage<br>that guy is spooking<br>hilarious<br>stupid stupid question<br>my friend<br>why am I getting the same<br>Twitter messages over and over again<br>stop cutting down trees this guy says yeah man<br>we gotta live like avatar brother<br>try to read these<br>and find one that’s reasonably interesting<br>god damn some of these questions are crazy<br>the ghost in the machine<br>yeah I mean look<br>it’s not my thought I mean<br>1 million people have come up with it<br>they have movies on it<br>I mean that terminator idea<br>that’s all about it rey kurtz will all his ideas<br>it’s all based on the same ideas that technologies<br>going somewhere<br>I mean it kind of makes sense<br>it’s like but you get caught up at john<br>kate and fucking tiger woods and all this nonsense and<br>and everybody forgets<br>you know<br>everybody forgets what the fuck is really going on<br>that we’re creating things<br>we have a culture we’re moving towards something<br>and it seems to me<br>my armchair<br>armchair psychologist self<br>not even psychologist armchair<br>futurist you know that something’s happening<br>you know we’re moving toward something<br>and all the blinders are in place<br>to make sure that we keep<br>going all the blinders<br>I mean that’s one of the weirdest things<br>about being a human being is that everybody<br>goes through this life<br>pretending like it’s going to lead to something<br>that you’re going to be able to be static<br>you know instead of treating it as this wild just<br>temporary experience<br>everybody treats it like it’s permanent<br>like you’re saving things<br>and you’re putting aside savings and you’re<br>you know you’re planning for the future<br>and you know<br>one day I’m gonna make it and we have this whole idea<br>like you’re gonna get somewhere<br>and then everything is gonna stop<br>but that’s just bullshit<br>no one’s just being real with us about that<br>we’re all<br>temporary and the fact that we don’t address that<br>and we’re not we don’t embrace<br>really embrace the moment<br>that’s like one of the most<br>important things about being a human<br>recognizing this shit is just fleeting<br>it’s gonna come and it’s gonna go and you gotta<br>just<br>pile in as much<br>enjoyment and pleasure and fun<br>and positive energy as you can<br>because that’s really what it’s all about<br>spread as much as you can leave as much<br>to help other people as you can<br>say as much as you think<br>that you think is gonna help other people<br>I mean that’s really what it’s all about<br>meanwhile we’re all fucking planning for a bigger house<br>you know working on saving for a bigger tv<br>constantly distracting ourselves with fucking items<br>items and<br>notions notions of retirement and the golden age<br>and someday I’m gonna do this<br>but you’re not doing shit it’s right now is someday<br>there’s no someday there’s this moment<br>and this moment goes on forever<br>there’s a bunch of shit happening during this moment<br>there’s things that keep going on<br>like the earth keeps spinning around a star<br>and you keep getting tired<br>and you have to rest for a little while<br>but it’s still the same goddamn moment<br>and we need to treat it like that<br>we need to treat it like it’s one big thing<br>you know and it’s not going to be here forever<br>it’s one big fucking ride<br>and it lasts 80 something years and then who knows<br>and who fucking knows<br>why do you think america’s never<br>made a big<br>deal out of Russia giving us the 9 11 monument<br>hmm<br>I don’t even know they did<br>haven’t thought about that<br>I don’t know um<br>I don’t even know what that monument is<br>you know I mean<br>look the whole 20th thing man<br>who the fuck knows what that’s all about<br>who the fuck knows what any of it is all about<br>do you write colony or does it flow out<br>you have to write<br>very important<br>you can’t just<br>flow it out<br>because you’ll forget a lot of the shit you say<br>you know you have to write it down<br>and writing it down helps you<br>come up with more things and branch off of it<br>it takes longer to like<br>to write a word that it does<br>to think of the word you know<br>you think like you’re writing polar bear<br>you know<br>you polar bear you think about a polar bear instantly<br>but you’re writing about that polar bear<br>as you’re writing<br>you’re in the act<br>of putting down<br>the letters in the act of putting together<br>to sentences<br>there’s much much much much more thinking<br>you know that’s one of the reasons why<br>my blogs<br>I think anybody’s writing<br>you know if you edit it will always sound<br>much smoother more precise more cun size than<br>these retarding ramblings that I do on u string<br>and when the u string ramblings I don’t have any notes<br>I don’t know what I’m gonna say<br>I don’t have a fucking clue<br>and that’s for me that’s the best way I do it<br>because I just get on<br>and I just<br>start talking about shit and then just let it happen<br>and let it flow out<br>but like<br>for stand up comedy you gotta do a lot of writing too<br>it’s got to be both<br>it’s got to be<br>you gotta have the ability to just flow with things<br>and like like this weekend<br>something happened with the<br>you know the killer whale thing and I<br>when I was in doubt<br>so I had like 10min on the killer whale<br>but it was all shit that I had like written down that<br>day and then just fucked around with that night<br>just went with it<br>so I think you got to have bolt<br>you have to have writing but you have to have<br>you have to be able to flow with things too<br>you have to be able to take chances too<br>you know you gotta<br>comedies like it’s like you have to have a road map<br>you have to know where you’re going<br>but you can take little detours<br>you know when you’re on your way<br>you have a map you know where you’re gonna go<br>you could go off into the woods for a little while<br>and sometimes when you go off<br>into the woods for a little while<br>you get more interesting shit out of it you know<br>and I think people appreciate it you know like when<br>something that happens<br>you know that day<br>with like the killer whale<br>and then a guy goes on stage<br>that night and talks about it<br>you know that this guy’s just winging this<br>I mean he had to wrote some stuff down but<br>he this isn’t<br>stuff he’s worked on<br>this isn’t some material he’s done 100 times<br>shit just happened yesterday<br>you know there’s something about that man<br>it makes it more fun<br>it makes it more<br>it’s more<br>alive or something you know people can be sure<br>you know part of comedy is like the trick<br>and the trick is<br>to make you think that I’m thinking about what<br>I’m thinking right now<br>you know but when you really can<br>pull that off it’s like there’s something<br>something extra special about it<br>so I think it’s both you know I think it’s both<br>you gotta write and you gotta fuck around to<br>what do I think of parallel universes<br>says ace of spades 1 3 6 9<br>you know it is more fascinating to me<br>people with numbers in the end of their names<br>what’s that all about especially when they have like 69<br>the rocker 69 shut the fuck up please<br>I’m in the 69 bro<br>I mean eating pussy while I get my dick sucked<br>that’s what’s in my name<br>I’m crazy plus you could have 69<br>they even can tell you to tell you to take it down<br>man you can’t have a mic<br>I like to eat pussy while I get my dick sucked<br>I can’t be your name<br>people would get upset at you<br>but you could just throw 69 there<br>and then give him a wink<br>hey man what’s at 69 at the end of your name about<br>anyway I forgot your fucking question<br>that’s how dumb it was<br>not really sir<br>I’m just fucking around<br>I really did forget your question though<br>sure couldn’t have been that fascinating<br>jimmy northern luzming<br>I love him too<br>I’m gonna see in a couple couple weeks<br>are you smart<br>because you’re funny or funny because you’re smart<br>you know<br>funny is just being honest and recognizing all the<br>fucking crazy shit that’s going on<br>it’s like the really<br>comedy is like really just tuning into<br>the retardedness of the universe<br>because it’s like it’s all there for you<br>you know I mean<br>you write it down and you expose it<br>but it’s like you know<br>the raw materials are all there<br>it’s like mining for diamonds in a room filled with<br>diamonds I mean that’s what it’s like<br>stand up comedy in america in 2010<br>it literally is like you know<br>like what do you do<br>oh I go out and I find money<br>where’s the money that’s every on the ground<br>I mean that’s really what it’s like<br>it’s like your raw material is life itself<br>and that’s what you mind you mind life<br>the ridiculousness of life whenever you see<br>warranted warranted irony<br>warranted things to be mocked warranted stupid shit<br>when it’s all right in front of your face<br>people complaining about avatar you know<br>meanwhile we got two wars going on<br>no one says a peep<br>I have not read christopher hitchin’s god is not great<br>but that guy is a<br>pretty badass arguer<br>he’s really good at trouncing people<br>I enjoy watching him<br>lash lash christians you know fundamentalist christians<br>he gives him a beating<br>it’s pretty interesting<br>no I never got a copy of the YouTube show<br>that I didn’t save<br>it was much like this one<br>I was just fucking around talking and<br>I forgot to save it this time I<br>know what the fuck I did wrong<br>I would make sure that I save it<br>what do I think<br>about the couple inches that the axis has shifted<br>I don’t know if it’s really a couple inches but<br>apparently the<br>the earthquake and Chile was so big<br>that it shortened our day<br>it changed our day by like<br>like a millisecond like<br>fraction of a millisecond whatever it is<br>but it’s a measurable amount that it’s short in our day<br>that’s how because it changed the<br>distribution of the mass in the earth<br>how fucking crazy is that<br>the earthquake was so strong it’s short in our day<br>which makes you think<br>like when earth gets hit by meteors<br>like giant fucking asteroids<br>like the one that killed the dinosaurs<br>I wonder if that can shorten or lengthen the day<br>I mean it seems like it could right<br>it seems like it only makes sense that it would like<br>if you add mass to the earth<br>so if these these things are gigantic you know<br>500 mile across<br>hunks of metal and rock and shit from space<br>they come slamming into the earth doesn’t<br>that that has to increase the mass of the earth right<br>unless it knocks off just as much as it puts back<br>and that’s how like<br>that’s how they believe the earth<br>developed a moon<br>they believe there was earth one and earth two<br>and earth one got hit by a fucking planet<br>we got hit by a planet<br>and apparently that happens like<br>that’s one of the crazy<br>could you imagine that we were about to get hit by a<br>planet you know<br>imagine if you look up and mars is like<br>right fucking there<br>like right behind the moon<br>and coming towards us<br>and there’s nothing we can do about it<br>what the fuck<br>like that’s possible<br>in some solar systems that happens to earth<br>it’s happened before<br>there’s a thing called bodeslaw<br>bodes law is the way it works I believe<br>I’ve been told at least by the scientist fellow<br>he told me that<br>the mass of there’s certain things<br>they measure about a planet<br>particularly the mass but a few other things too<br>and in measuring those they can pretty accurately<br>judge where the next planet will be<br>in that solar system<br>well it applies to all the planets in our solar system<br>except to<br>mars and jupiter<br>because mars and jupiter<br>apparently according to this gentleman<br>I’m not sure if it’s correct<br>look it up google it please<br>he said that mars and jupiter<br>in fact there should be a planet in between them<br>and according to bodeslaw but there is not<br>instead there is an asteroid belt which<br>makes some theorize that that is the result of another<br>planetary collision<br>or maybe the same one that created earth<br>that like something got fucking cracked<br>like I guess it happens a lot<br>you know it’s even written about in the sumerian text<br>the sumerian text depicts<br>you know this is<br>some shit that was written like 6000 years ago on<br>clay tablets depicts that<br>that’s also<br>how earth was created depicts that we you know<br>these two plants called tiamat and marduk collided<br>and they created earth<br>it’s very similar to our own earth one and earth two<br>hypothesis so it’s really fucking fascinating shit man<br>you know to the idea that<br>the universe is static it’s not static at all<br>you know the center of every single<br>galaxy is a supermassive black hole<br>that’s exactly one half<br>of 1% of the mass of the galaxy<br>so the bigger the galaxy<br>the bigger the supermassive black hole<br>and those things are just eating stars up all the time<br>I mean you see like the big spiral around like<br>black holes they’re eating they’re eating planets<br>I mean they’re going<br>getting forced into the event horizon<br>it’s really really really nutty shit<br>you know we could get hit by a fucking planet<br>I mean that could be real fucking asteroid<br>we can get hit by a goddamn planet<br>I mean it hasn’t happened<br>you know<br>in billions and billions and billions of years<br>it’s not likely to happen<br>but whatever it happens<br>fucking nuts<br>tiamatin marduk babylonian gods may the earth<br>yeah it’s all this<br>it’s all from the same part of the earth<br>or yeah it’s from Iraq<br>where Iraq is today used to be sumer<br>and<br>the sumerian text all<br>talks about the creation of the earth<br>and you could dismiss it<br>but they knew a lot of shit<br>first of all they had a very accurate depiction of our<br>our solar system<br>with all the planets and the correct<br>size and the correct orbit<br>including pluto<br>and we didn’t know about pluto<br>until 1930<br>so who the fuck knows but they also talk about<br>beings from another planet that supposedly<br>created human beings using genetic engineering<br>it’s very very possible<br>that what we get<br>with these old old civilizations<br>that had a tremendous amount of knowledge<br>it’s very possible that what that is<br>is the remnants of an even<br>earlier civilization that was possibly wiped out<br>like our idea that earth<br>that it moves on a<br>very very linear that<br>our society progresses on a very linear line<br>that’s easy to follow<br>you know like there’s cave men<br>and at the end there’s human beings<br>in 2010 that’s very disputed<br>there’s a lot of people<br>graham hancock is one of my favorites<br>john anthony west is another<br>there’s<br>a lot of these archaeologists that support the idea<br>that<br>it’s very possible that human beings have been around<br>way way way longer than we think<br>like 30 forty<br>hundreds of thousands of years like we don’t know<br>that our culture<br>the reason why our culture is so advanced<br>today over such a short period of time<br>is because we’re really<br>re learning complex things<br>like technology and tools and you<br>know electricity in the internet and in fact<br>these old cultures that had all this<br>knowledge of genetics<br>that existed in the sumerian culture<br>and all that the reason<br>why these people had<br>this is because that’s knowledge that they got from<br>an even earlier culture that was probably wiped out<br>by some fucking<br>super volcano or an earthquake or a meteor<br>who knows I mean<br>there’s a lot of evidence<br>that some crazy shit has happened over<br>and over and over again on this planet<br>and not just crazy shit like<br>killing the dinosaurs<br>but crazy shit like during our lifetime<br>human beings were certainly around 10,000 years ago<br>but not only that<br>what else was around 10,000 years ago<br>fucking woolly mammoths and saber toothed tigers and<br>half a north america was under a mile high<br>sheet of ice there was a crazy ice h going on<br>and it ended almost instantaneously with<br>these animals becoming extinct almost instantaneously<br>and there’s a lot of people that theorize<br>that’s because of some sort of a<br>natural cataclysmic disaster<br>some sort of a meteor impact<br>or something<br>fucking nutty that wiped out all the wooly mammus<br>all the sabertooth tiger<br>fucked up all cultures all over the world<br>and sort of reset human civilization<br>and then it’s possible that people existed a long long<br>long time before that<br>and the culture existed a long long time before that<br>you know and people say<br>well where’s the evidence of that culture<br>that’s the real tricky thing<br>because what evidence would there be<br>you know<br>you ever see that there’s like a discovery channel show<br>I believe it is life after people<br>it shows like how quickly things get eaten up<br>you know in Detroit<br>Detroit is so bad right now<br>the economy so fucked up and crazy<br>that bears are moving back into Detroit<br>they have bear sightings in the fucking city<br>that’s no bullshit because<br>there’s so desolate that so many houses are abandoned<br>and these houses<br>plants are growing up through the fucking floorboards<br>I mean it’s only been a few years and nature is<br>already trying to devour these buildings<br>nature’s trees are covering these<br>and this is a cold ass fucking climate<br>where these trees can only grow<br>you know a few months out of the year<br>it’s really really nutty shit<br>there’s some images in Russia there too<br>of all these different<br>places in Russia that were abandoned after<br>the fall of the soviet union<br>and these places were abandoned<br>and now nature is just taking them over<br>trees are growing through buildings and<br>just literally consuming things<br>I think that<br>you know it’s probably<br>difficult to find evidence of a culture<br>a couple thousand years ago<br>unless it’s in stone<br>you know the stuff that we find<br>from thousands of years ago<br>it’s like the pyramid type stuff you know stone things<br>those things last forever stone tablets clay pottery<br>stone buildings that shit lasts<br>forever but<br>metal electronics like that’s just gonna be gone<br>that stuff will<br>just get eaten up by the earth and swallow<br>evidence of a culture 30,000 years ago<br>that’s ridiculous there’s not gonna be anything<br>it’ll all get swallowed<br>you know I mean<br>there are so many<br>temples that they find<br>that are swallowed up by the rainforest<br>in south america mayan temples<br>incredibly complex<br>Pyramids and all these different things that are<br>covered up by rainforest<br>there’s probably<br>hundreds of them that they’ve never found<br>they just they just<br>they waited too long<br>and they’re just covered up by trees<br>when they’re in Mexico city<br>in Mexico city they’re always like building things<br>and then finding<br>really old<br>you know mayan ruins underneath Mexico city<br>they find that shit all the time<br>where they have to halt construction<br>because they found some monuments and they found some<br>you know ancient walls or something<br>and turns out there’s a whole goddamn city down there<br>not a lot of evidence<br>not a lot of evidence happens after<br>you know<br>just 10,000 years<br>so I have a feeling that what<br>what we get out of like the sumerian culture<br>and all these people that knew all these things<br>like that knew about mars or newt about pluto<br>and knew about genetic engineering<br>all these ideas<br>it’s very possible<br>very<br>very possible that what they knew was just some shit<br>that ancient ancient civilizations<br>who were just as advanced as us maybe<br>became advanced in a different way<br>but just as advanced as us<br>that they had figured it out<br>you know like<br>that’s so true with so many different cultures<br>you know and<br>the idea that like you know<br>people read the sumerian text and they say well<br>you know these<br>sumerians say that<br>the autonoke came from another galaxy<br>and you know they they created humans with you know<br>with genetic engineering<br>so well there it’s written in stone<br>it’s got to be true<br>no people are full of shit in 2010<br>you don’t think they were full of shit<br>5000 years bc<br>the sumerian text could easily be<br>6000 years ago as version of scientology<br>it’s very very very possible<br>you know just because it’s written down on rocks<br>doesn’t mean it’s real<br>you know we don’t know<br>there’s a lot of goddamn questions<br>all right I’m only gonna ramble<br>for a little bit longer<br>because I gotta get the fuck out of here<br>because I gotta go to Canada bitches<br>oh shit<br>like I said I’m headed there this weekend very excited<br>can’t wait looking forward to it very much so<br>I am going to<br>casino nova scotia and hal fax Thursday night<br>and then Friday night<br>I’m in the branson center in Ottawa<br>and then Saturday night<br>queen elizabeth theater in Toronto<br>you dirty bitches<br>and thank you everyone for coming out to these shows<br>I’m really excited<br>it’s the most fun thing that I do for<br>sure you know<br>I mean I love worker for the ufc and I love<br>I mean<br>I’ve loved a lot of different things that I’ve done but<br>nothing’s more fun than comedy<br>it’s just it’s the craziest<br>most open ended art form you know<br>and it’s the the the art form that I have the<br>the most<br>the most control over so it’s just<br>you know it’s the you<br>could be the freest<br>you can you can show<br>people exactly what you’re thinking<br>say exactly which on your mind<br>and this too and this thing I think<br>you know I talked to a comic about this<br>we saying like you know<br>you do your rambling on this YouTube thing<br>or this u stream thing about it<br>he said aren’t you like eating up some material<br>I said not really<br>I think<br>I think I’m like coming up in material doing this<br>because I’m not crazy<br>so I never get a chance to just talk like this<br>I never get a chance to have like a one way<br>this is like a one way conversation<br>you can’t talk back<br>I mean I’m listening to some of the shit that you say<br>on the Twitter<br>but I mean I’m not you don’t get to talk<br>I only talk for an hour and that’s a very unnatural<br>and I think rambling long<br>long rants like that that’s like<br>that’s the best way<br>that’s the best way to come up with new shit there’s<br>writing and writing is important too<br>but this is another<br>interesting component and I think<br>I think doing these u stream things<br>has been taken my material to another level<br>another level<br>yes<br>doing the u stream thing<br>doing what<br>doing the u stream<br>you stream<br>things has been taking my material to another level<br>I think<br>it gives me more of an opportunity to fuck around<br>more of an opportunity just rant about shit<br>you know when you ran about shit<br>sometimes you were ranting about shit with a buddy<br>and then he’ll say something<br>you forget what you were gonna say<br>and then<br>you go back to it but you don’t have it anymore<br>but with this it’s like<br>1h I think I’m gonna switch to<br>doing it twice a week though<br>I think what I’m gonna do is like this<br>1h and I’m gonna do it twice a week<br>so Wednesday<br>and I might do Monday too<br>so as of right now we’re gonna leave it as is<br>I’m just gonna keep doing wednesdays<br>but I think I’m gonna try to do it twice a week<br>I think it’s better to do a little less time<br>a little more often<br>and I wouldn’t want to listen to me<br>talk for more than a fucking hour<br>and you know if you’re at work<br>listening to me ramble for more than an hour<br>jesus goddamn cries go to work<br>get your shit done unless you can get your shit done<br>while you’re doing what I’m doing<br>listening to me and then I would say<br>god damn you got a mindless ass job<br>if you can listen to my nonsense<br>and still get done what you’re doing<br>no problem whatsoever<br>what are you doing you fixing shoes what are you doing<br>nothing wrong with fixing shoes<br>all right ladies and gentlemen<br>I think that’s it<br>this guy says plus one twice a week<br>yeah well we’re gonna have all the shows up in mp three<br>brian redband just finished a site that he wrote and<br>in the<br>in the next day or two we’ll have that new site up<br>and the new site will have the ability to<br>directly podcast so<br>it’ll all be on itunes<br>I know I keep fucking promising that but<br>whatever you can get this<br>I mean it’s better to have it on podcast form but<br>you can watch this<br>you know if you gotta watch you gotta watch it<br>all right<br>thank you very much<br>I really do enjoy doing these things<br>and I really appreciate that<br>all you motherfuckers come out and I appreciate that<br>all you guys come to shows and<br>as crazy as they yet<br>and as much as it seems like total chaos<br>I fucking I love it all<br>I love it all and I’m<br>very thankful very happy that you guys keep coming out<br>so I’ll see you in Canada<br>next week I’m in tempe Arizona I’m at the tempe<br>improv next Thursday Friday Saturday can’t falcon wait<br>I’ll be there with my road dog<br>ari shafir<br>and brian redband will be there too and by then<br>should have the new site up and
