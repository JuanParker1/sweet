happened to him<br>I think he’s he does<br>well yeah I think he’s that he does a lot of shows and<br>they sell out and stuff like that<br>so kiss him dad fans ask he’s got he’s got a<br>that’s actually a nice guy<br>yeah that’s the thing a lot of guys like to bag<br>on the guy for because when he wanted he was really<br>really green and new<br>but I don’t fall anybody for that<br>yeah he’s always been nice to me<br>he’s been nice to me<br>I’ve never seen him once do stand up<br>and I saw him why<br>I judged the first<br>last comic standing and he fucking crushed<br>yeah you did<br>the last fact that was when<br>we caught ant stealing material and that’s when<br>buddy back it screamed at me<br>right right almost had a heart attack<br>that was a fucked up story because this dude aunt was<br>stealing jokes<br>I mean like book jokes right like<br>jokes had a movies old garland shit<br>and you know I’ve complimented him first<br>to say to your really good performer<br>you got a lot of energy<br>you know but I’ve heard that shit before<br>and then buddy hack it’s time you fucking asshole<br>who the fuck are you you fucking is how<br>my cat just got scared spaz spaz<br>come here

honey<br>anyway the story was with buddy hackett<br>when I when I started<br>when I started saying that this cow steel material<br>buddy hackett<br>got really upset because<br>but you know buddy hackett’s like an old school<br>like he’s a comic from like you know<br>the cat scales days and those guys all stole material<br>you know they all did<br>each other’s jokes and there was no internet back then<br>yeah right wasn’t even any fucking tv<br>you had some gags and he did him and nobody knew<br>yeah and if you didn’t do your gags first<br>you know the guy in front of you did him<br>you

one<br>sided the one sided phone conversation<br>to larry’s but there’s a lot of guys<br>from that era who did the same<br>exact<br>phone bit so<br>well well<br>anyway while<br>he was yelling at me<br>there was a part of me that wanted to go<br>shut the fuck up<br>you old cocksucker<br>but I didn’t<br>I swap and he died two weeks later<br>which means he was real close to death that night<br>so if I yelled at him<br>he might have killed over and fucking died right there<br>and it was there was a<br>ten percent ten percent of me<br>that was like why am I listening to this old douchebag<br>because my philosophy on old people has always been<br>that old assholes were assholes and they were young<br>they just survived you know right<br>you just became an asshole when you turned 80<br>that guy’s a douchebag<br>and<br>I thought about yelling at him but I said you know what<br>that’s not gonna help anybody<br>and I’m like what’s the point<br>it’s all on television so

drinking no more bad stuff<br>john heffron is all about positive energy<br>and tony robbins right<br>kind of yeah but the tony robbins without the walking<br>on fire and going to a seminar with<br>20,000 really motivated people<br>yeah what is the walking on fire<br>it probably helps you it teaches you to walk on fire<br>how you would then apply that skill to other<br>things in your life<br>I have no idea<br>you know<br>because even if you have an argument with your girl<br>you can’t go well<br>I can walk on fire<br>it won’t apply<br>to anything else but walking on fire right<br>like guys fighting that bus boards right it’s great<br>if a guy jumps in front of you with six boards<br>yeah what’s the fucking point of breaking boards<br>I don’t get that or<br>the break in the<br>I guess it’s your power and a punch but not well<br>that is if a guy is standing there<br>boards break pretty easy<br>that’s the sad thing<br>those boards ease for demonstrations<br>outbreak<br>when I was a kid who was a little type of window<br>whenever we used to open up a<br>new school<br>we would all have to go and do demonstrations<br>and what part of the demonstration wants you<br>how to kick boards<br>break boards so though<br>it was just always seemed so silly<br>that’s awesome<br>what’s gonna say<br>we’re talking about the near and linguistic stuff<br>oh yeah so buddy hackett<br>so you’re doing all this programming<br>and this programming leads to<br>you better performances on stage<br>yeah it’s basically that it just kind of<br>rewires your brains everybody<br>if something happens you probably racked<br>similar in every signal situation<br>so this kind of just change your brain to maybe take a<br>the best<br>it gives you options to handle situations where<br>you have zero options<br>then you’re just going to freak up<br>and if you have a few<br>you usually take the best option for<br>but it also keeps you from doing<br>shitty things right<br>it keeps you from ruining your life<br>it keeps you yeah for me<br>yeah for me what I did is you kind of work backwards<br>you figure out what you want to accomplish<br>and then you kind of<br>get all those feelings<br>and what would feel like once you accomplish those<br>and it kind of let your brain know<br>this is the way I want to go<br>this is make every decision<br>in the right way to obtain that goal<br>you know I think for me<br>it’s you know<br>some people go well that’s all common sense stuff but<br>there’s a big difference<br>between<br>common sense and<br>you know it’s common knowledge or actually applying it<br>right now<br>but you apply it now you’re all about doing that right<br>yeah I do it before I get on stage<br>I do some techniques to get me because you know<br>as stand ups you can get in<br>people don’t realize it’s not<br>what you travel with guys that you like<br>but a lot of times I’m working with dudes that<br>bug me yeah no problem<br>yeah or whatever<br>so you get in a bad mood for 8 billion different<br>reasons before<br>you get on stage<br>and then you enter that stage<br>and you’re kind of in a pissy mood<br>which then that comes across to the crowd<br>or what I would do<br>is I would see a group of guys<br>let’s say and in my head I would go<br>all those guys are gonna heckle<br>and then I start playing this movie in my head<br>all they’re gonna heckle right at my favorite joke<br>oh it’s gonna wreck that thing<br>and I start to go<br>like literally play it out as if it happens<br>so then when I got on stage<br>I was already mad at these guys<br>that didn’t say anything<br>so I take the stage with a little bit more<br>testosterone and then that<br>puts a weird vibe on the crowd even though those guys<br>might have not set anything<br>the entire show<br>but now I do that with every part of my life<br>and I think a lot of people do you know you like<br>oh look at that girl over there I’d ask her out<br>she’s probably gonna say no though<br>she’s probably gonna<br>say no and make me feel stupid in front of all<br>my other friends and blah blah blah<br>do the same there’s a lag<br>there is a definitely a lag because I’m watching us<br>on the video<br>and it’s totally different from what we’re saying<br>it’s like john still talking on the video<br>but right now I’m always<br>you’re always gonna have that though<br>really<br>why is that because you streamed gay as fuck it’s just<br>we’re live streaming video<br>you know is it would it be better if we were on blog tv<br>yeah<br>what about justin dot tv with everybody<br>who cares if people who know<br>people watching this care man how did they know<br>there’s a guy saying lag he’s upset<br>no how did they know<br>there’s a lag because he’s watching the video<br>and the sound is different<br>no no the sounding video is the same is it yeah okay<br>it’s<br>a 15 seconds delay<br>how the hell is he know there’s a lag down<br>he’s probably on a slow shitty here<br>you got a shitty ass internet connection faggot<br>why are you blaming us<br>then a will dial up john heffron<br>not only is he a stand up comedian<br>he also<br>hosted the mma awards this year which was a total<br>fucking disaster really completely<br>you told me I didn’t say it was a total<br>the edited version came out awesome the way you told it<br>well for me for me it was the check cleared<br>the check is clear let’s talk<br>yeah the check is clear<br>but for me it was where<br>the<br>people who got to see it on verses got to see it live<br>as if it was happening so there was a lot of<br>shoot this guy this guy sucks<br>to those shoot this guy to me talking about me hosting<br>was it I didn’t get to see it to those sitting<br>in the safety of their computer and being maybe<br>15 or 16 years old you would probably think<br>that it sucked<br>not realizing that hosting something like that<br>oh ladies and gentlemen the sound<br>if you just have to press refresh if you press refresh<br>your sound and video should sink up<br>that’s what’s going on<br>some dude said that the mma awards would laying<br>well you know what<br>well that compared to<br>oh yeah my thing to that lame this is all<br>my thing is is lame to what is<br>what I don’t get is people compare them<br>and may awards to what<br>the oscars no no<br>it’s just like non interesting to watch<br>you know what’s a clip show<br>it was a highlighted<br>clip show and people got to realize I think<br>for the first one and the budget they had<br>that’s why you know<br>guys like you<br>or kevinjit people always like why is the rogan host<br>why isn’t kevinjit like big guys that people know<br>honestly because they had $0<br>well it’s also<br>the the hosting thing<br>I couldn’t have hosted it because<br>I’m a commentator for the you see<br>yeah and they wanted to make it none<br>they wanted some even though<br>I’m a huge mma fan and I’m as<br>objective as possible<br>when it comes to other organizations<br>like<br>I’m always talking about theore<br>and I’m always talking about ayoki<br>and all these different guys who fight<br>alastar overam<br>and different guys are fighting other organizations<br>I’m I’m a big believer in<br>you know you have to look at all<br>I mean if you’re a fan<br>you have to like all the different organizations<br>you can’t just be loyal<br>obviously the ufc’s the greatest job I’ve ever had<br>and it’s a fucking awesome gig<br>and I appreciate the hell out of it and I love the job<br>but as a fan you know you can’t just<br>only follow the fighters and the fights that are in<br>that organization<br>that’s just silly<br>I love my favorite thing<br>I tweeted this so I was watching you do accommodating<br>one of the fights<br>I love when you call out<br>an entire group of 20,000 people<br>for booing<br>because<br>I get mad like they were just drunk<br>yeah the bottom line is that I<br>understand if they didn’t like the decision<br>that makes sense but once the dude<br>is talking when they’re interviewing the dude<br>boo and him<br>all he did was like aaron simpson versus tom laurel<br>yeah it was the last one like you can’t boot<br>aaron simpson the guy fought his ass off<br>he got hurt really bad the first round<br>and came back in one the second and the third<br>and it was a really gutty performance man<br>and it had mad endurance and even in the third round<br>he outpaced tom lawler<br>I mean it was just a great fight<br>overall great fight<br>and I don’t know how anybody couldn’t have enjoyed it<br>I mean<br>I think in situations like that I hate close decisions<br>because close decisions like that<br>man it could have gone either right<br>and so the fight really took place<br>everybody saw what happened<br>and to decide<br>that one guy wanted or another guy wanted<br>when it’s that close<br>I would much rather have a draw<br>I think that fight could have easily been a draw<br>you know a lot of people thought that tom lawler won<br>which I definitely think he won the first round<br>but I think aaron simpson won the second and 3rd<br>but although not in is large a margin 2nd<br>very slight in the third a little bit more<br>I think if you looked at it on paper you could say well<br>maybe you could give the first round ten eight<br>but the bottom line is<br>forget about all that the bottom line is<br>it was a great fight<br>yeah other guys should feel like a loser<br>like there’s no way<br>tom waller should feel like a loser after that fight<br>and there’s no way aaron simpson should have got booed<br>yeah well<br>anytime I’ve been at life fight or you hear the people<br>I don’t get mad but I love when people start going<br>you know start yelling<br>stand them up when they’ve been on the ground for<br>maybe 35 seconds yeah it’s the or if guys<br>or if guys feel out each other like I’m okay<br>with and I’ve sparred<br>I mean I spar<br>mma is my golf I don’t spar to really<br>try to tell everybody I enjoy the workout of it<br>but even you know you have to feel out of die<br>you don’t just go go and then<br>start you know<br>people expect like hockey fights<br>sometimes where it just erupts immediately<br>they walk out they go toe to toe in starting<br>well I think it’s just that the action is great<br>it’s so exciting that people want to<br>keep that part going<br>and then when it goes to the ground<br>the uneducated fans<br>if they don’t know what’s going on<br>they get upset but<br>problem is the referees and small towns<br>like when we go to Memphis I don’t say small towns<br>Memphis is in a small town but we go outside of vegas<br>a lot of times they use local referees and these guys<br>they they’re too busy<br>they get involved in the action too much<br>you know fight guys fight guys<br>you know they’re fighting<br>you know like guys in the guard he’s working his guard<br>he’s trying for an arm bars trying for something<br>I’m gonna stand yep I’m stand yet like<br>what the fuck you talking about you understand them up<br>these guys are fighting<br>I don’t think most are part of fighting<br>I don’t think most people realize the difficulty<br>I mean you just have<br>somebody your size if not a little bit bigger<br>lay on top of you<br>and then stand up from that position<br>just letting that person<br>just with their weights and how hard it is<br>just to stand up<br>what do you mean<br>like if I’m on<br>if I’m on my back and you’re on top of me and I<br>and I scramble<br>and I get it that we both we stand up together<br>right that’s a huge feet and it’s yeah it is<br>you know it maybe not that<br>it should be that guy<br>the only way you should get up is if you got up<br>it shouldn’t be the referee stands you have<br>I hate all that shit<br>I’ve always said that if<br>someone like brock lesner can take you down<br>and molest you for 5min<br>then that’s tough shit<br>tough shit he’s got you on your back<br>you gotta find a<br>way to get back up tp<br>and if you can’t it’s 5min of him punching you<br>in the face and that’s life<br>and if your technique to void that is to turn<br>and run in circles so we can’t tackle you<br>then do yeah that’s it<br>yeah you know<br>it is whatever it is<br>and believe me that’s gonna<br>what’s gonna decide<br>your career is gonna be fans<br>and whether fans like your style<br>whether or not you sell tickets<br>whether or not you know you<br>optimize your potential as a mixed martial artist<br>and the fans are gonna<br>let you know whether or not they like your style<br>and if you got a boring ass style<br>even if you like winning fights<br>nobody’s gonna give a shit<br>they’re not gonna buy your paper views<br>and that’s like that’s like<br>that’s commerce<br>you know that’s how it’s supposed to work<br>you know it’s supposed to be<br>let let the market dictate<br>what you know whether people like people or not<br>no I<br>you said you sent a clip the other day of tag team<br>oh yeah but what do you think the evolution<br>if you were just to pretend to evolution<br>you think maybe in<br>40 years there’d be like maybe num chucks<br>on a rat like on a hook on the side of the cage<br>where then no I think<br>that’s not as fun<br>the fun thing is man to man no weapons<br>that’s what I mean<br>you could go to roman gladiator style<br>have dudes have sword fights and they would be<br>certainly be fucking crazy but<br>ultimately I don’t think it would be as enjoyable<br>it’d just be more fucked up<br>because your champion like a staff<br>yeah I must say that I was<br>miyamoto musashi you know musashi beat 62 men in<br>sword fights but unless you’re musashi<br>you know what’s gonna happen<br>you’re gonna get fuckin sliced up<br>you know it sucks about that tag team ideas<br>half the people probably think that’s a great idea<br>they all came from wrestling no they don’t<br>everybody’s wrestling fans fancy fucking turkey jesse<br>no<br>go to the YouTube clip that I posted up on tag team mma<br>every fucking car really<br>what the fuck is this gay shit<br>what was this what happened<br>what happened from the transition of wrestling<br>thinking that’s an awesome idea<br>to all those fans<br>well wesley’s fame I know<br>I mean basically the real the evolution is war<br>it’s like football<br>it’s like a team of mma guys on one side of the field<br>and it’s yeah<br>that’s true and that’s important to know it<br>I got a hawk hogan story for you<br>by the way when we were at the ufc<br>he sat right in front of me and he has this really<br>weird hair where it looks like it’s a wig almost<br>but he pulled out a comb<br>and during the ufc the whole time<br>he was just conning the back of his hair<br>and like just like kind of go like this<br>and like flipping<br>it over his shoulder and I was just like<br>is this really<br>the hall cogan that I know is combing his hair<br>well he probably does it for like it’s public a show<br>like part of his image images<br>you know because I mean he’s<br>silly he’s always on when he’s out in public<br>you know he’s the hulkster<br>dude interview in him was the show<br>was that he was fucking awesome man<br>he was really nice guy huh he’s a great guy<br>real nice guy<br>every interview<br>well not every interview but you’ve done<br>I saw you interview<br>there’s been a fight in the stands right before<br>you go to talk to them<br>leah it happened with a sebastian salon<br>you’re an interview rocky and there<br>was a thing I<br>did it happen with hog<br>there’s always like a little moment right before<br>it’s funny I guess or to make it more realistic<br>maybe you could have cage fighting<br>or<br>where you have to two fighters and then random people<br>standing around like a bar fight<br>so then you’d have to worry about throwing a punch<br>back in heaven<br>it’s gonna be robots immine in the future<br>no<br>I got human chimp hybrids<br>people are gonna like<br>infuse their body with chimp dna<br>and you’re able to jump off the top of the cage<br>they’re gonna be so much stronger and faster<br>well this is gonna be some definitely<br>this is gonna be genetic engineering in the future and<br>when genetic engineering becomes a reality<br>forget about steroid steroids are gonna be nonsense<br>it’s gonna be nothing<br>when they get gene biostat inhibitors<br>you know that you ever seen the video of<br>there’s<br>there’s a couple of kids that have been born with<br>milestat and problems<br>and what happens is they develop like<br>a extreme amount of muscle<br>they have all that like there’s whip<br>it’s there’s a dog called a whip it<br>and they breed these dogs to try to make them<br>you know fast to make them sleek and run fast<br>and occasionally<br>they have an error in their genetics and they get<br>giant muscles<br>they look like they don’t even look really photoshop<br>but it’s a real dog<br>like super royated up<br>shredded and no fat means incredible<br>but that’s all they’ve done it are ready to mice<br>they’ve engineered mice so that these mice<br>have this mile statin inhibitor situation going on and<br>they have giant muscles and they can<br>they live longer I mean<br>I’m off for it man<br>I hope all that stuff comes around<br>right around the time where<br>you know I’m in my 60 seventies<br>it’s gonna happen man I’m gonna civicis alone it well<br>everything is going in a direction where<br>like science fiction<br>like the things that we thought of as being<br>completely ridiculous in the 19 eighties<br>the stuff that you would see in a movie<br>I mean it’s all real now<br>you see that new microsoft touch<br>thing where they have a table<br>and you can put something on the table<br>and it recognizes what that’s something<br>is and gives you information on it<br>I mean that’s like minority of type shit<br>I mean this is all gonna happen<br>I was talking about that new cell phone idea<br>that nokia has<br>where it’s a phone<br>that you’re talking and then you flip it on your wrist<br>when you’re doing<br>it’s like turns into jewelry<br>yeah and it wraps around you<br>yeah yeah it’s like though it’s like those bracelets<br>there’s old metal bracelets you used to like<br>flip on your wrist<br>you know like girls would have them to it<br>but it’s a cell phone<br>it’s a bendable lcd<br>and they just happen at the other day<br>and it’s pretty much what it is<br>they can unstrapement it out<br>use it as a phone<br>and then when they’re done you just<br>flip it on your wrist<br>I saw that they had this what’s that<br>neo technology where they took shark skin<br>it’s all bladed<br>and they made this suit<br>that’s almost unstabbable and stuff for like soldiers<br>where you wear<br>almost like a wetsuit<br>but<br>nothing can get through it<br>so it’s like kevlar<br>but it’s thinner and stuff than it’s ever been before<br>so you can wear it as a full body<br>and you can’t stab something with it<br>well regular kevlar can be<br>stabbed straight on here with a knife<br>you can get through kevlar<br>but this is some<br>shark skin is what<br>some guy invented he invented it to stop shark attacks<br>but it’s not that chain mail stuff<br>it’s like a wetsuit that can’t be<br>so now they’re messing with that stuff<br>one day I’m gonna have a real iron man suit<br>that’s right it’s gonna be crazy if you don’t already<br>I mean you gotta hit now<br>all the guys are gonna look like halo the dudes from<br>from halo definitely<br>all that technology<br>it’s gonna be like<br>star wars<br>where you’re gonna have a helmet that you pull out<br>so you know<br>you can’t breathe the air outside and stuff<br>well yeah this is gonna be that<br>but I think most of the war is gonna be fought like<br>what the cia is doing in Pakistan right now<br>they got drones<br>and these drones are flying over Pakistan<br>just launching missiles down on people<br>the bottom line is that all things accelerate<br>no things stay<br>exactly where they are<br>and the only time<br>they degrass is when there’s a gigantic national<br>catastrophe or you know somebody blows up a<br>bunch of nuclear weapons and you know we go back to<br>being fucking caveman<br>I mean that’s the only way things are gonna decelerate<br>but the way things are going right now<br>they’re gonna move in a crazier and crazy direction<br>I mean<br>we went from from bows and arrows to guns to cannons<br>and it keeps going and going and going<br>and now it’s fucking drones<br>the fire missiles from the sky<br>I mean that’s and then you know<br>like the star wars program they were trying to do<br>during the ragan administration<br>you know they were trying to have it so that they have<br>satellites that can shoot down missiles<br>from space but apparently that was all bullshit<br>apparently that never really worked<br>and apparently there’s a gigantic conspiracy<br>wrapped around<br>the<br>scientist that were involved in the star wars program<br>because apparently a<br>fuckload of them have died<br>under suspicious causals<br>really<br>yeah yeah if you google it<br>anybody wants to google it<br>we could google it right now<br>and I’ll put up a link for you guys<br>but I don’t know if this is a legit<br>obviously<br>I don’t know if it’s a legit conspiracy theory<br>but the star wars scientists<br>on the side note on<br>the conspiracy theory stuffs that you talk about<br>is there one site if you let’s say you’re a new guy<br>ads jones drop hell coppers infowars<br>comlation gentlemen info wars<br>geomarconi scientist death conspiracy theorist<br>mystery of the dead scientist conspiracy<br>hmm wikipedi has a<br>little pay job<br>between nineteen<br>eighty two and nineteen ninety twenty five<br>british based<br>gec marconi scientists and engineers who work<br>oh that’s a stingray<br>oh yeah star wars defense initiative yeah<br>died under mysterious circumstances<br>wow<br>police<br>investigations found those death to be unconnected<br>oh no<br>the same police are out taser and grandma’s own shit<br>is that who did it<br>probably the snacks out of the vending machine<br>star wars is probably how aids was created<br>there’s so many sites on this<br>I don’t even want to link it<br>because I just<br>yeah you know what I’ll do I’ll link the google search<br>so you do your own work<br>because<br>who the fuck knows<br>how many these guys are completely crazy<br>so I just sent it up there<br>who knows<br>who knows how many guys are<br>completely out of the fucking mind and who knows<br>whether or not it’s real<br>you know<br>star wars was reagan right<br>yeah well the reagan administration was famous for<br>a bunch of secret shit what was going on<br>this is reagan introducing star wars<br>his announcement of what it was back in the day<br>yeah<br>what are you showing it<br>yeah what are you gonna show video or something<br>don’t do that nobody gives a fuck yeah<br>don’t put that up okay<br>star war it’s the whole<br>thing why not<br>we can show people of them introducing star wars<br>because I don’t want to put them<br>it was just a program where they shot<br>supposedly had satellites they could shoot down<br>missiles from space<br>but apparently it was never functional<br>never proven to be effective<br>they spent billions and billions of dollars on it<br>and all these scientists dying<br>the big theory was that you know<br>these guys knew too much<br>and they knew that it was horseshit so<br>they had to kill them off before they talked<br>I wouldn’t I wouldn’t put it past them<br>you know you get the cia involved<br>and if you ever read like economic<br>confessions of an economic hitman<br>and you find out the shit that our government does<br>to other countries<br>they’d kill scientists they’d kill anybody<br>they don’t give a fuck<br>you know<br>the same people that wanted us to go to war in Iraq<br>and we’re willing to<br>lie about weapons of mass destruction<br>you know everybody’s<br>going on and on about September 11th like<br>do you really<br>think the government<br>would allow innocent people<br>to die during September 11 so they could go to war<br>I don’t know but<br>do you really<br>think they believe<br>there was weapons of mass destruction<br>do you really<br>think that we’re over in Iraq and afghanistan for good<br>reasons that benefit you and I<br>no and millions of people have died because of that<br>at least 1 million Iraq civilians have<br>died because of that<br>and so if they’re willing to do that<br>you don’t think they’re willing to kill a few<br>thousand here and there<br>oh right of course they are<br>and forget about the few thousand that died<br>during 9 11<br>the million people that died in Iraq or human beings<br>they’re just as<br>legitimate as the people that died in the twin towers<br>I mean it’s all completely ridiculous<br>someone says can we change topic to something fun<br>allah be praised is his name<br>semi said please look up the definition of literally<br>you you mike and dana<br>use that word too much<br>and you don’t know what it means<br>oh how do you know what I know<br>saga what’s that<br>the literal translation<br>I know what literally means you know<br>I was talking to somebody<br>who has a joe organ ufc<br>drinking game<br>where the guy gets rocked<br>no<br>on the button he pre watched it<br>I forgot what he said he pre<br>he pre rocked watched it and then bet his friends<br>bjpen<br>spider monkey lakes<br>is it turned at monkey legs<br>it’s kind of a weird brand one<br>I don’t know if you’ve ever said<br>I’ve never heard that I might have said it<br>we know when you do 100 yeah yeah<br>sees I don’t know<br>I might have said that one day and forgot I said it<br>he doesn’t have spider man listen to this guy<br>there’s no such thing as a legit conspiracy theory<br>okay smart man<br>like you fucking know how funnier people<br>there’s no such thing as real conspiracy theory<br>of course there are stupid<br>look up the gulf of tonkin<br>the gulf of tonkin incident is<br>a real conspiracy theory where the government really<br>did lie and say that there was an attack<br>on american citizens<br>and that’s what god is into the Vietnam war<br>look up the<br>look up<br>the northwoods document the northwoods document is a<br>real conspiracy that the joint chiefs of<br>staff drafted up and signed<br>and then it was vetoed by kennedy<br>and what it was was<br>basically they were trying to get people<br>enthusiastic about a war with cuba<br>and they were going to plan<br>attacks on american civilians<br>they were going to blow up an airliner<br>and blame it on cuba<br>and say that americans were on board<br>they were going to attack ships<br>they were going to attack guantanamo bay<br>they were going to throw mortars into<br>guantanamo bay and they were ready for us casualties<br>which meant they were<br>willing to kill americans<br>in order to get us to go to war with cuba<br>these are real<br>they look up<br>how about fucking cigarettes<br>you want a real conspiracy theory<br>how come politicians all want to talk<br>about drugs and we need to keep drugs out of schools<br>drugs in this country can’t even fucking come close<br>to the death and destruction<br>the health problems that cigarettes have caused<br>but yet<br>you don’t hear a fucking peep out of those guys<br>about cigarettes<br>cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year<br>in this country alone<br>every fucking year<br>that’s a real legit conspiracy<br>where no one is talking about it<br>and the reason<br>why they’re not talking about it is because<br>tobacco companies finance campaigns of politicians<br>those are conspiracies<br>what a conspiracy is is<br>someone conspires to do something<br>there’s hundreds of legit conspiracies<br>look up the iran contra affair<br>look up the fact that oliver north<br>and all those guys were involved in doing illegal shit<br>in order to help what they bring in co<br>I just watching where they bring in cocaine<br>into the us well<br>that’s the accusation<br>and there’s a bunch of<br>books that have been written right<br>and cia agents who have said that<br>there’s a guy named gary webb<br>who’s got a bunch of shit on that<br>and there was a dude named barry seal who actually<br>was bringing in cocaine from other countries<br>got caught<br>and when he was about to go to trial was murdered<br>and that was to go the bringing coke from<br>those<br>like afghanistan type countries to help support them<br>to fight the russians<br>yeah and here’s another one is<br>you know people say oh man<br>the cia is good to help us and sure<br>some cia<br>I’m sure do that but the cia<br>one of the planes that’s been to guantanmo bay<br>crash last year<br>in Mexico with four tons of cocaine<br>I’m gonna put up that link<br>yeah and it did even fucking make the news man<br>it make royders<br>and it didn’t make any of the the big news programs<br>I’ll put up that link for you guys<br>but this is a fucking cia plane<br>like rupert was the la cop that busted that yeah<br>yeah that is special on hpos on the two<br>because there are two black dudes that were the ones<br>at all funnel through yeah<br>the bottom line about<br>human beings though<br>is that people are so<br>lack of days ago when it comes to shed it just so<br>you know you could<br>that stuff could be on the news and<br>people would care more about john and kate<br>john has to pay $10,000 a month and<br>child support and alimony<br>how’s he gonna do it<br>and that would be big news<br>whereas people wouldn’t give a fuck about<br>you know the cia selling drugs<br>they would all you have to do is have one person<br>on television say it’s bullshit<br>and that’s all the<br>I mean that’s all<br>you need to get 90% of the people to believe it<br>and a lot of those shows and a lot of the news ones<br>there’s people that’s what they do for a living<br>they say<br>they can put their name in a database to be an expert<br>about whatever<br>and then cnn or<br>box ago we need a guy that knows about<br>and then you’re the expert on<br>drug injection<br>what’s been proven that oil companies<br>have hired scientists to dispute<br>the fact that human beings have created global warming<br>you know who the fuck<br>knows whether or not they’re right or wrong<br>when it comes to global warming<br>and most people that argue it<br>they argue it from the point of being a conservative<br>or being a liberal<br>liberals always say we have to stop and<br>conservative say there’s no connection<br>and it’s just because there are a bunch<br>of fucking parents to hear<br>all these different people<br>rush limbo or whoever on the radio<br>saying that there’s no connection<br>that you’re these celly liberals<br>and they just repeat the same<br>dumb shit and conservatives<br>do that and then liberals<br>they see that fucking al gore cock sucker<br>and they go like al gore<br>so the mean<br>my al gore has made $1 billion off of this fucking<br>climate gate<br>if you look at<br>what al gore has made<br>the money that al gore has made<br>since then inconvenient truth came out<br>it’s fucking staggering<br>he’s made an incredible amount of money off of this<br>and the people that would benefit from all these<br>carbon taxes<br>I mean they’re setting this up to make money<br>and that’s what they’re doing<br>no one’s doing this<br>there’s sure there’s a few<br>scientists that are doing with the right intentions<br>but most of the politicians that are pushing this<br>they have alterior motives<br>and they’re trying to make money off of this shit<br>hey joe rogan did you hear johnny bananas 21 at gmail<br>com says did you hear that the y chromosome is<br>evolving faster than the x chromosome<br>that’s because we’re men bitch<br>johnny bananas we’re the only ones with the why<br>the women don’t get the why the why is the future<br>I just saw a documentary about that<br>males are disappearing because of all the chemicals<br>yeah I’ve heard that too<br>that’s why guys act more girlish now if you look at<br>well this is a surplus of men<br>when there’s a surplus of men rather men<br>act more aggressive<br>and grow more facial hair<br>and become more masculinated<br>and have more testosterone<br>when there’s a surplus of women<br>men tend to relax<br>and they tend to be more feminine<br>and they tend to shave more<br>and be more metrosection<br>yeah this one was about<br>all the chemicals that probably<br>our parents or our parents parents did in the sixties<br>all the plastics and all that kind of stuff<br>where they said wasn’t bad for you<br>now they realize it is<br>and for some reason that those chemicals<br>affect men more<br>like they found these alligators that live by<br>let’s say dow<br>in the swamps had smaller balls than alligators<br>you know generations earlier<br>that all those<br>chemicals were shrinking the alligator balls<br>I don’t know what job you have<br>that’s your guy that you know one guy goes<br>I’m gonna measure it<br>alligator balls yeah<br>you know<br>I’m gonna measure it and we might need this data later<br>but that’s what<br>that’s what they say<br>is just from all the chemicals and stuff<br>that men are acting less like<br>men and producing more sperm<br>I think in the thing more sperm<br>no less burm like so<br>young guys now<br>have less sperm than their dads probably have<br>which it should be<br>well that’s the internet<br>we’re getting rid of more sperm than our dads<br>huh because we’re jerking on<br>you dad didn’t have that much<br>you didn’t you did he craft with<br>I bet it’s very much more difficult for your dad<br>to be or your assessive about masturbation<br>because they still have to set up a projector<br>pull the shades down<br>screen run that little sixteen millimeter<br>or watch some black and white old lady argo<br>less molestation<br>nowadays too i wonder what the odds are unless<br>well it actually goes order<br>epic’s down i don’t think it’s down<br>you don’t think<br>or go even back further than that<br>that was guys had to put up the projector<br>but even though the guys before that had to<br>paint stuff on walls and caves<br>and then you know there’s way more people now<br>there’s way more people now<br>so there’s way more molestation about poor capita<br>yeah I’m wonder I wonder<br>well you know the Japanese believe<br>the Japanese believe that if you show all that<br>shit you show<br>rave and molestation<br>and crazy sex<br>you know like<br>that’s why they’re in the schoolgirls on that shit<br>they feel like that it gets it out of your system<br>that if you watch like violence in<br>video and movie form<br>that somehow another it gets it out of your system<br>why do they blur all their porn now<br>they only blur the pubes yeah that’s weird it’s weird<br>very weird wait<br>you’re allowed to get fucked by a tentacle<br>but you can’t see it<br>can’t you see pussy or<br>you do not know the whole thing’s but it’s all<br>the whole pussy that bad<br>witness reload<br>but if you’re squint like in the old days in the news<br>if you’re squint you can see this<br>and then I find myself like squinting going<br>there’s other porn that I could be watching<br>that’s way more<br>like that old old school kind of French<br>kind of european porn<br>yeah do you remember<br>when you were<br>the old days when you would go on the road<br>and you would go to hotel rooms and<br>the dirty movies would be scrambled<br>yeah but they would only be like wiggly<br>yeah if you could all mine through them<br>you’d see like a tit<br>I mean it’s like a dick that would go in a mouth and<br>you’d have enough to jerk off to<br>you used to be able to those<br>you used to be able to get like a three<br>or 4min preview<br>to see if you want it<br>so you’d have 10 and<br>you hit the second preview I was proud of myself<br>I would I would get hard<br>and then as the preview was going I would be done<br>15 seconds in the or is weird with the vhs<br>like if you borrowed porn from somebody you could see<br>like what their thing was because<br>you put it in and hit play whatever scene<br>you know that they just hit stop after they were done<br>so you’re like really<br>that’s the thing<br>yeah did someone have a bit about that<br>and chris rock had a bit about that about how he went<br>turned out one of his porns<br>and he had left it a certain scene<br>but then because of the vhs tape<br>then we went to it the next time<br>it was a different scene<br>it’s like someone’s been watching my shit<br>oh that’s funny<br>it’s so true right<br>that would yeah I<br>remember renting vcrs this is like we’re 18<br>rent vcr<br>and then leave it in there when you take it back<br>or something<br>or you’d rip off of the<br>I remember like birthday parties<br>my mom would go to the library<br>and rent a movie projector<br>just to show like movies<br>or like birthday party yeah<br>do you think the ca<br>had a hand in gary webb’s death I don’t know the<br>story behind gary webb’s death<br>just added gary web die<br>so the I tablet’s going to be announced next week<br>supposedly by apple<br>and they don’t know what the name is<br>it’s like I slate or ipad<br>and I’m sitting in bed at like four in the morning<br>and I’m like thinking what could it be called<br>and I’m thinking why wouldn’t they call it like I tab<br>what if they call it I tab<br>it’s not like I go online I buy I tab tv<br>just in case you know<br>I’m addicted to domain names<br>it’s pretty ridiculous<br>I’ve got I’ve got like 8 trillion that I<br>would like never use for any reason<br>do you have a lot what’s some of them that you own<br>I’ve owned<br>let’s see this is back in aol day is like<br>obviously I never did<br>lol was whoa whoa whoa whoa<br>stop stop stop this gary web guys<br>they’re asking<br>that they were talking about<br>the whole dropped all the<br>stuff about the cia and the the<br>contras and everything<br>committed suicide according to the corner<br>shot himself in the face twice<br>well it didn’t work the first time generally like<br>no why am I still there<br>I guess yeah<br>that was the guy that said all the<br>the cocaine guy<br>credible sources cook<br>yeah yeah this is the guy that<br>was releasing all the information about the cia<br>sal and cocaine<br>alright hold on a second on top of this now<br>paste it for you guys<br>that was an interesting<br>cause when I ran contrast up was going on<br>I think I was like<br>you know 11 or 12 or so you know in there okay yeah<br>I had a all over north for president t shirt<br>yeah I didn’t even<br>that’s interesting<br>shot himself in the fucking face twice that’s hardcore<br>oh<br>ouch<br>hmm<br>who knows anyway<br>what are you talking about the eye tablet<br>no like our addiction addiction to domain names<br>like what<br>what’s some domain names that you did you buy<br>cause I I’ll think of something<br>usually when I’m really stoned<br>and I feel like oh I<br>did you buy john heffrons socks john have fun’s a fag<br>john have fun’s a loser I should have should<br>or scam john hefron scam<br>because you always see those at the first<br>whatever<br>whatever you’re looking you always see the word<br>scam at the top<br>and then when you click on whatever it is<br>it just pro whatever you’re looking<br>because I think naturally if you’re looking to buy<br>something yeah<br>you see the scam<br>you’re like well I’ll go to the negative first<br>oh some dude said it was doug stanhope’s bit about his<br>mom with the porno<br>yeah that makes sense that makes sense awful<br>there’s a company called ripoff report<br>and this is like I don’t know how this is legal or<br>at all if somebody’s mad<br>at your company or something like that<br>they can put something on there<br>and what this company does is<br>it uses spam techniques where<br>it spams like<br>message boards and all this shit all day long<br>so google puts it on the top of your list<br>my friend has a fashion company that does like<br>dresses and stuff like that<br>and the first thing that comes up when you google is<br>rip off report<br>this person’s ripping you off<br>and blah blah blah blah and michelle are my friends<br>like how do I get rid of this<br>and they’re like<br>well if you give us $2000 we’ll take it off<br>it’s like what yeah that seems<br>hold on a second so the company that<br>reports on people for scams<br>they’re basically just extorting people<br>yes it’s called rip off report<br>and then the funny thing is<br>you can pay them and they’ll take<br>your name off of it<br>holy shit a ripoffert court<br>com and it seems like it’s a legit company<br>so if you have a problem with<br>somebody’s business or something like that you can say<br>the right layer like this person<br>ripped me off and stuff like that<br>but that’s extortion<br>how is that extortion<br>and if you go online there’s a lot of people<br>suing this company<br>there’s about 12 different<br>lawsuits going on for this company right now<br>but she’s been trying everything<br>to get this shit off<br>she was on tv the other day doesn’t matter<br>still first thing you google her name it comes up<br>what is her name<br>michelle windle<br>am I c h e l l e<br>windle w e n and somebody like that<br>I don’t know how successful<br>but either way<br>people like it don’t have rip off report<br>wow<br>don’t have the money to go after her to go after them<br>you know I mean that’s pretty expensive<br>I was going to sue<br>a company recently<br>and it would just it ended up being just so much money<br>that you had to go<br>well do I want to use that just to<br>say that I’m right<br>or do you just say you know both<br>of those<br>people are ex employees too that wrote those things<br>real as she fired<br>yeah it seems like<br>there’d be some kind of like<br>libel or something<br>yeah well they’re getting sued but I mean<br>it’s okay<br>little room thanks<br>but the whole thing that’s weird about it is is<br>that it’s like<br>what was anytime why can fears here<br>ari chaffeer just showed up ladies and gentlemen<br>that crazy jew<br>we didn’t even call him and tell him to come here<br>I have a special guest<br>my special guest this

something<br>leaving his bong hole<br>yeah he talks about<br>someone says<br>I’m disappointed that you’re not getting high<br>the reason why we’re not getting high was because<br>up until a few

something<br>else that you don’t have to be a fan<br>to see the dates<br>oh really yeah it’s<br>what’s the two it’s a fan page and a group<br>and the group<br>it’s so annoying<br>facebook’s so annoying with this<br>but group anyway you know<br>what’s many of the death of facebook<br>by the way is<br>I don’t want any more pillows sent to me<br>I don’t want any you can turn all that off<br>I don’t want to see any of that<br>you turn off any kind of of that<br>pillows or blessings I appreciate this<br>how do you it’s in your settings<br>it’s so confusing<br>yeah like there’s this pillow

putting<br>it’s my wall who would have ever thought<br>that would be popular<br>why have you been to the mall<br>hey let me glitter your iphone<br>or people that can tag you like<br>I’ll get comics that I’ll have like their video<br>on YouTube and they’ll tag me<br>and then suddenly their video of them on stage is on my<br>it’s my it’s like my property that’s my grass<br>stay off of my grass me and joe<br>we’re talking about this other dig<br>we have a friend that doesn’t want you know people<br>he’s very private<br>but since somebody just posted a photo of them<br>and now every single person<br>that that person’s friends with us can see like<br>you know all you<br>can go right to that photo<br>yeah and if it’s private yeah yeah facebook’s a mess<br>yeah security settings are sketchy<br>and there was a dude who was a former<br>facebook employee<br>that was talking about it<br>you know<br>divulging on the information about how they do things<br>well you know that’s how they’re doing<br>a lot of people are seeing a lot of people’s identity<br>is they’ll go you and I’ll<br>get enough information from your site<br>just in general that I that I can then use that<br>to peace mail<br>well how about this there was a fucking deal your stuff<br>a bunch of dudes are getting scammed<br>this is very common<br>where guys are pretending to be chicks<br>and they’re pretending to be chicks online<br>and some dude was posing as a maxim model and scam<br>$15,000 out of some doctor and Florida<br>send pictures photoshop naked pictures<br>and and apparently this dude had<br>a

of people<br>so it’s not that annoying right<br>it’s weird how like it’s so different like myspace I<br>had no problem getting frames you know like on<br>or whatever but but Twitter<br>people are a little bit more picky<br>because they have to read your shit every day<br>will it say that again<br>it’s different<br>how like Twitter<br>like some people are huge on Twitter you know<br>you wouldn’t think they’re<br>they are like Twitter makes no sense to me<br>like numbers why<br>you know like ash and kusher<br>is the most<br>popular where he’s on magazines and he goes on cnn<br>and he talks about his Twitter on cnn<br>and he’s so does larry king every day<br>but he’s not even a quarter<br>that yeah but larry king’s a fucking dinosaur<br>larry king here<br>nobody gives a shit about larry

tired<br>but you know you still have good energy but then<br>the first roll<br>you have full energy<br>you know the first roll<br>you feel great<br>but if you roll with a tough guy<br>and everybody attempts planet<br>I mean<br>you’re rolling with brown belts and purple belts<br>all those dudes are tough<br>all those dudes are capable of tapping you out<br>and then it’s a matter of how much endurance you have<br>because if you<br>you know you put yourself in bad positions you know<br>especially if you’re pulling guard all the time<br>because I’m trying to work on my bottom game<br>try try to work on my guard<br>and if you get tapped I get tapped<br>shit I get tapped all the time once a month<br>if you don’t if you don’t get tapped<br>you either not rolling with good people<br>or

questions are being raised about its use<br>one issue in particular should children<br>take it to<br>share calvin here with an incredible story about one<br>family’s fights<br>for their son share<br>that’s right michael in victoria<br>when you say that it sounds so shocking to so many<br>but california’s prop 2 15<br>the compassionate usac<br>was passed by voters a decade ago<br>and it does allow<br>seriously ill patients with a doctor’s recommendation<br>to use marijuana legally but<br>what about for children<br>we did find this one<br>family with a truly remarkable tale to tell us<br>in this ktla exclusive report<br>can you tell me what schools like you sam<br>titanic big one<br>this is sam a 10 year old who lives with his dad<br>his mom and his sister lucy in northern California<br>sam has autism<br>from age two till eight<br>sam’s disorder made him violence and aggressive<br>his parents<br>steve and angela were truly living a nightmare every<br>day he got off where he was<br>hurting other children at school and in public places<br>last times would be<br>stay in line at a store and he would just<br>instantly just<br>bolt off and go and hit another child in the face<br>one time he pulled the tv down<br>he knocked over all the furniture I mean and I got<br>and I had to put him in a hole<br>for<br>maybe an hour<br>I mean just where his whole body was spasmy<br>it was just you know<br>I would just lay there crying and just hold him<br>sam’s parents worked with expert doctors<br>who recommended a succession<br>of conventional prescription medications<br>like whispered doll and a host of others<br>but sam just gained 20 pounds and<br>became harder to handle<br>we were so scared look okay<br>he’s getting more dangerous<br>he’s getting bigger and stronger<br>now he’s 20 pounds bigger<br>from the respirat all<br>the child that we had grown to love<br>was gone it was just like when you looked at him<br>when you talk to him<br>he had just disappeared<br>finally at their wits end<br>and faced with a very<br>real prospect of needing to institutionalize their son<br>sam’s parents decided to try something<br>unconventional and<br>controversial<br>last year<br>they began treating sam with medical marijuana<br>you think about it<br>it really is the perfect medication<br>for that kind of behavior<br>it’s just very calming<br>so this is the medicine right here<br>steve and angela got a recommendation<br>from a medical cannabis doctor<br>they told sam’s pediatrician about their plan<br>and steve grew sam’s new medicine in their backyard<br>we had six plants here<br>this is where steve took out his<br>tomato plants to grow and then harvest<br>the cannabis from the marijuana flowers<br>he could make good concentrated form<br>what people refer to as hash<br>this ball represents roughly four<br>months of doses for sam<br>so I just take my lighter<br>steve softens the cannabis with heat<br>then takes what appears to be just a<br>jack of pot sam’s dose for the day<br>what affected the medical cannabis have on sam<br>well the first time we did it we just wanted to do<br>to see if it would work at all<br>it was just an amazing experience<br>the man account will never forget it<br>to watch what happened to him<br>it was just like wow he’s back<br>this anguish and this pinto bridge and this<br>you know obsessiveness<br>it’s just like it just went away<br>just like it just calmed him down<br>while we were with the family<br>we watched<br>steve put sam’s daily dose in a piece of melon<br>and take it to him<br>we saw that for him<br>yeah that’s good<br>johnny bernie<br>within roughly 20min the effects were clear<br>where earlier sam had been animated in Nancy<br>after eating his speck of hash<br>sam became calm relaxed and social<br>as a mother how would you feel<br>about people saying to you that<br>you’re getting your son stoned every day<br>at first I was very concerned about that<br>but recently I’ve been sharing<br>the story with more more people<br>you know friends and co workers<br>and I find that you know<br>the more I tell people the more I share it with people<br>but more comfortable I am with it<br>it has saved our lives<br>and I think about what it’s done for our son<br>could sam story help others<br>respected<br>la area pediatrician christopher tolsher says<br>we don’t know enough<br>about cannabis for kids<br>for all the parents out there<br>whose children may have autism<br>I think the message here is that this is intriguing<br>information<br>that needs more research before we can confidently say<br>that marijuana is a safe and effective treatment<br>for autism complications<br>our best but for this California family<br>medical marijuana has<br>literally been an answer to their prayers<br>and a homecoming for their son it was just<br>a medication that we saw that<br>gave us the results that we were always hoping for<br>I mean I think that really is<br>a key is that he was happy again<br>he was smiling and laughing and<br>we had lost that for so long and it was so sad<br>wonder because we’d ever see that again<br>it just feels like I have more control<br>now to help my son instead of depending on doctors who<br>may have the best intentions but they don’t know<br>when sam needs<br>I want to do what’s best for my son<br>and I’ll do whatever I can for him<br>well one important note<br>sam’s parents tell us<br>that they have followed the<br>letter of the law regarding his medication<br>and that they’ve grown<br>only the amount of marijuana that prop to 15 allows<br>the medication is for sam<br>and for nobody else<br>shared<br>does he does he take this medication every single day<br>you know they started off from at 7:00 in the morning<br>he would take it<br>then they would give him a second<br>dose in the afternoon<br>but after two years he started this at eight<br>he’s now 10 they sometimes don’t have to give it to him<br>and only give it to him as needed which is incredible<br>it really has changed his behavior according to them<br>wow all right<br>share terrific story thank you for the report<br>thank you and for more on sam’s story<br>information on treating children with autism<br>go to our website ktla<br>com click on the special report section<br>there you’ll find<br>shares report and link to the american<br>academy of pediatrics<br>I want a party with that kid<br>so I was listening to the blind last night the<br>doctor drew is on<br>and he was talking about marijuana and how<br>he was just so he just<br>obviously fight that he’s like they’re just<br>what they’re just dumb people<br>yeah he’s so silly about his take on marijuana<br>the fight medical marijuana<br>people that want medical marijuana<br>he thinks they’re silly in the ruining america<br>and he thinks that all drugs are bad<br>that the one state of mind<br>the state of mind that you’re<br>currently in is the only one<br>he shouldn’t be drunk he shouldn’t be high<br>he shouldn’t be drugged up<br>he does not get it that is not true<br>there are drugs that are terrible for you<br>the ones you see on his show<br>the crystal meth the fucking<br>heroin and oxycontins<br>those are all fucking horrible for you<br>that’s a guarantee<br>but zola what does he say about that shit’s all tit<br>well for some people<br>it’s not what does he say about it<br>I don’t know you have to ask him but<br>what he says about marijuana is ridiculous<br>because he lumps marijuana in with like heroin<br>and cause my mom does<br>she got all drugs<br>yeah it’s what he does<br>I’d rather that he looks<br>it’s addictive<br>but there’s so much proof that it’s not addictive<br>and it’s like<br>my argument about it is like anything can be addictive<br>you can get addicted to cheeseburgers<br>if you’re fucking retard<br>you could be one of those<br>dudes who gets addicted to washing his<br>hands you know people become compulsive about it<br>goodbye perfect exam<br>people get addicted to things<br>man that’s what we do<br>it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have the things<br>if other people are telling you they benefit from it<br>that’s what’s fucking stupid<br>about this whole marijuana thing<br>there’s no heroin activists<br>there’s no you know there’s no crystal meth activist<br>there’s like you’ve got to get on crystal matter right<br>but people keep telling you that<br>weed is<br>enhanced their lives and help the way they think<br>and made them a better person<br>and that fuck doesn’t want to believe that dude in the<br>article on in<br>what was that commerce magazine<br>fortune fortune magazine yeah<br>the one dude was on the caith the first like<br>six people case study<br>he said he’s never gotten high up pop<br>but he smokes it constantly all day long<br>all it helps is with this<br>like arthritis or whatever it is<br>well we say it’s super barbecued if you keep going<br>yeah if you if<br>and then he realized that his friends were telling<br>you string just stopped our recording for some reason<br>all right man probably<br>the fucking man<br>the man ladies and gentlemen refresh your browsers people<br>the man apparently was just fucking our ass<br>that’s crazy like<br>it just went off air<br>and then everything came back going by itself<br>yeah he took it with his friends as he wanted to be a downer<br>because they were all taken yeah<br>this is you told the story<br>and he smoke is like a fuck if he didn’t feel anything<br>so he was like all right<br>but then he didn’t want to like be the one left out<br>so he’s like fuck i’ll smoke with you guys<br>he would pass it and he was like taste on and then he realized<br>he could for the first time<br>like years and years he could actually<br>sit there with those legs and arms like<br>cranny what about sean roush<br>maybe it could help him<br>i don’t know i just don’t know why that guy does not smoke pot<br>no doug doesn’t doug doesn’t smoke weed<br>you would think that doug would smoke weed<br>stan hope does not like weed really yeah<br>he’s done it i’ve done mushrooms with stan hope we did dmt<br>he’ll go to other dimensions what does he do pot<br>he does like pot<br>makes a paranoid he doesn’t like the fact<br>i understand that is nigel side effect of everything<br>for everybody well<br>i think what the paranoia that pot gives you is really<br>it’s almost like the opposite of alcohol<br>because alcohol makes you look through a tube<br>alcohol you’re like looking at the world through<br>yeah whoo too<br>you’re not seeing but<br>marijuana is the opposite marijuana releases your<br>blinders yeah<br>i see it in front of me brian it went off in brian<br>it went off in brian for a second it blipped did it yeah<br>just so you guys know it’s not me fucking it up<br>but u stream is just fucking up right now<br>if you can’t see red band<br>he’s actually<br>sticking his cock into the computer trying to fuck it<br>you can’t blame brian ladies and gentlemen don’t be mean<br>this is difficult to figure out the stupid shit out ultimately<br>i would love to have this on my website<br>on joerogan net<br>but right now i don’t think the technology is available<br>it’s not quite ready<br>but this is ideally the best way to do a show<br>you know this is way more fun than doing<br>some show that’s on television that nobody gives a shit about<br>you know i mean this is we could do whatever the fuck<br>we want you don’t have to look at it<br>i don’t want anything<br>from you no one’s getting paid<br>just for fun you know<br>you have interesting people over and you talk<br>right i mean like how many times have you done what’s about it<br>brian girl blaming me so i’m gonna keep my hands up yeah<br>brian<br>i read brian on this<br>in the cone in situation how many times have you done like<br>a talk show and it’s like<br>you prepare for it it’s like a big deal<br>and then you you know sit down and you talk<br>to someone for like seven minutes<br>and you’re like i didn’t even say anything<br>you know we get to talk about anything i mean<br>i had a few topics that kind of got out of the way<br>a little bit but<br>fairly seventy thing and then<br>and every one of those shows are set up for that reason<br>that

you’re on chelsea handler show yeah<br>those guys on there say like<br>four five words that’s it and then you’re done yeah<br>and then they’re done<br>yeah it’s real weird and then people go oh you were great<br>but that’s what they want<br>short attention span bing bang see this guy real quick<br>but i mean but that’s the if you want to go for like<br>if you want to go for like diaver you know just<br>just a shot in the dark with people<br>that’s what you should give them<br>you should give them the shortest quickest little things<br>as fast as you can so they don’t lose interest<br>but at the end of the day<br>do you want<br>the people that lose interest that easy to pay attention to you<br>no no it happens because you’re doing a numbers game yeah<br>but then again<br>i mean how many times using a youtube clip<br>and you start to open<br>it up you see<br>nine and a half minutes you’re like fuck it<br>i don’t even want to start<br>you know we’re all those people yeah<br>yeah but

one girl jokingly said<br>you know what we could do is<br>we could say that you raved us and but how much money would we<br>get and they were like<br>she said it as a joke so immediately<br>said let’s go<br>knocked on his neighbor’s door and said hey<br>whatever meet my two friends<br>so he’d have one other person<br>to see their condition when they left<br>so they couldn’t then make up this story and i had another<br>famous friend<br>he would every time he’d hook up with a girl in a room<br>he was a way famous he’d go to the front desk girl<br>he’d walk out that girl and whoever’s there<br>he would stop so that girl would talk to it that person<br>so there’s one other person that see<br>she didn’t run out all disheveled like what just happened wow<br>just as a backup because you’re honest i just want to go to bed<br>see you later<br>yeah but you don’t know that girl so<br>you know to a lot i mean to a lot of people<br>people that are like famous<br>like some famous rock star or something like yeah<br>that person is like they’re they’re so unfair<br>their situation it’s so unfair<br>how much more they have yeah how much money<br>yeah how much better their life is it’s so unfair<br>that people feel like you owe them something<br>like you got an unfair amount<br>so let’s try to take from you so<br>there’s a lot of people that don’t even feel bad about like<br>fake lawsuits they don’t even feel bad<br>they feel like they’re like oh<br>the rich have the rich man fuck the rich they got<br>and how did you make that money if someone got fucked over<br>yeah you know this rock is gonna worse that man well<br>you just run over my foot do you set them the other day<br>and they like played back the video<br>he didn’t even get hit by the car<br>and he was just tryna hey<br>couldn’t the paparazzi’s ran<br>i always think of like<br>have some kind of thing we hit one button<br>and you zap<br>all the other like kind of computers that around you yeah<br>they have this spray in<br>it you know what the paparazzis is the same thing<br>they’re just a bunch of people<br>that are making a live and doing something negative<br>and this they don’t need to do that but it’s also<br>sort of negative because a lot of times<br>they call those people’s yes<br>i’ll be at the ib come meet me out front<br>right and go after them there’s a lot of people that like it<br>but when you’re chasing someone<br>someone’s all upset with you like<br>they have their kids or something<br>like dr drew by the way<br>we were talking about dr drew<br>i think his stance on pod is retarded<br>but he’s a really nice guy<br>i’ve done a show of<br>the loveline show and he’s i’ve met her much time<br>he’s a really cool guy<br>and he told me that he was in hawaii and<br>the<br>fucking paparazzi were taking pictures of his crit of his kids<br>him and his kids yeah and crazy or something well<br>it was worth something<br>that they make money man you get a like a juicy picture<br>you can make some madly<br>how about that picture of john travolta kissing that<br>dude somebody got paid<br>for that how bad was it i saw one of the lips<br>mmm i saw one of them<br>when you freeze frame or kiss<br>it’ll never look like a casual pencil it’s awesome<br>i love how john travolta rocks<br>a fabulous wig<br>you know and just yeah man it is some pictures he’s balding<br>another pictures get the best head of hair ever<br>it’s awesome the tmz i saw<br>one of the guys<br>who works on tmz one of the guys said we saw soon so<br>at the airport and<br>i wanted to go up to him so bad with a camera just<br>sticking in his face and ask some dumb questions and yeah<br>i probably could have sold that<br>back<br>to tmz that’s one of the things i wanted to do as a sketch that<br>will do it or just go fucking<br>order or can the guy that does tmz<br>can he handle that<br>fifteen minute show without taking a drink of water<br>because he has like a sippy cup<br>that he just there’s no way that’s water<br>so it’s evil because those guys are making fun of people<br>that are on tv<br>yet every one of them wants to be so famous and is enjoying<br>all the fame they’re getting from being on the show<br>but that’s legitimate too because some people like the way<br>they’re bitchy<br>like they wish they could be that bitchy<br>and they like watching them it’s like a form of entertainment<br>a lot of what the chosen handler show is too<br>yeah let’s shut on people we wish we could work with yes<br>exactly but you know what there’s a place for that<br>too<br>it’s the same thing as rich people to get upset at poor people<br>it’s like people were not famous they like fuck them pickad<br>go after tiger woods you know go find them<br>he’s got a billion dollars fuck him<br>like some woman actually said this on the jimmy kimball show<br>she was<br>running a website where people could find people’s houses<br>and or no no<br>no it was<br>you would say where the celebrity is at any given moment oh<br>yeah yeah<br>you would and jimmy kimmels don’t you understand<br>that there’s like stalkers or this could be dangerous<br>and she goes well<br>i’m sure that they sleep well on<br>all their money like<br>a bed full of money and it’s like really<br>like that’s how you look at it like it’s<br>you’re willing to put people yeah<br>put people like<br>especially young girls<br>like you know how some dudes get fucking really<br>nutty about young girls like they get crazy like<br>that one girl that got shot<br>it was like when i first came to hollywood<br>some girl got shot it was on a tiny shocker<br>wow people understand how black hair<br>she was really pretty<br>she was like a childhood not childhood star but like<br>twenty two year old four<br>she became famous when she was young and<br>some dude just got obsessed with her found out where she lived<br>she opened the door and shot her in the chest<br>if i don’t understand how scary like stalkers out when i<br>used to do radio detroit<br>this girl was in<br>the fifteen sixteen page letters not one<br>piece of white left on the paper so it was written<br>sideways anyway about<br>i had fun going out with you looking for a house<br>shit that never happened you know<br>i heard about your secret messages that<br>and then she went away and then she came back<br>and every time might be in detroit<br>she would leave these letters when your wife’s gone<br>and it’s just us<br>and you know crazy<br>stuff so i want to go get a restraining order<br>against her because she was showing up at my shows and<br>would find out where i would be and the judge wasn’t fucker<br>no no no good gosh no but it was<br>nothing nothing nothing<br>yeah yeah totally i just wanted no<br>no just trying to think how far back was this yeah yeah no<br>what was this it was<br>it’s been about ten fifteen years<br>and the guy wouldn’t the judge would not get what<br>she wanted he wanted to hear her<br>side of the story now i had<br>a stack of papers this big of her saying<br>she came to the raider station i worked out with some of my<br>stuff she goes john leptis it was an empty can of tuna fish<br>whoa junk mail and baby shoes right<br>and then she got to your house well<br>no this was from her place i guess<br>and then i had<br>stacks of letters saying i hear the secret messages<br>that you’re giving me i will respond to him when you say this<br>it means this<br>but when you go to his vial a restraining order the judge<br>you get less than a paragraph to write why<br>you don’t get to hand in any of the psycho stuff<br>so then and then he saw that and then<br>the guy who did it from he goes he’s a dude<br>he probably thinks you’re a pussy<br>that you can handle<br>the judge no<br>that because i’m a guy and i have this girl stalker<br>the judge thinks that yes<br>like you’re pushing your guy handle the girl<br>don’t bring us involved it was<br>his attitude so i couldn’t i couldn’t find that<br>was the judges attitude that’s what<br>and you know what<br>that was that was that was before that chick up<br>no this i tried doing this<br>i tried doing this a couple years ago<br>but it doesn’t<br>a year ago but it doesn’t apply to california<br>so i go through all this work<br>get it down to michigan<br>they come out to california<br>doesn’t mean anything you gotta refile one in california<br>she drop flies in texas to see you<br>doesn’t matter now you have to file one in texas really<br>and i’m a so i could imagine not put this information on yeah<br>yeah hey<br>you know britty murphy the actresses just died yeah<br>mom and her husband<br>has been doing it toward<br>all the talk<br>shows and i got to catch it today on the today show yeah<br>it’s how fucked up<br>your daughter just died and they’re fucking<br>they’re just sitting there like for no reason<br>not promoting anything and we’re trying to like do anything<br>but just like i’ve seen them on like four different talk shows<br>the last it’s weird but they do it for money and they do it just<br>like the people<br>attention or whatever it says only about their daughter<br>the worst is like<br>and coming up we have britney murphy’s mom<br>and britney’s murphy’s mom just sitting there<br>and she knows the cameras on she goes<br>and it was it’s not crying animally no no no<br>you find it on youtube are we hulu or whatever<br>and it is disturbing the watch<br>like it was so gross and the husband was so what<br>was the accusation<br>what is the you still don’t know<br>well what’s the isn’t there like your current<br>they were saying it was drugs but then they said<br>so it wasn’t<br>like that it was just so involved when she was young<br>i don’t think it was a weird<br>situational though really<br>it just came out to<br>shower is talking about heroin<br>and all their childs and sold ocean they still don’t know yet<br>but that’s kind of weird that they stone the well<br>it’s kind of weird<br>but isn’t it kind of where the husband did want an autopsy<br>yes you think<br>i think that’s very fun and if a thirty year old person dies<br>you want to know what the fuck happened<br>but not jewish are there<br>he doesn’t look jewish<br>why it’s against religion<br>it’s against your religion and you’ll see basic<br>what happens if you murder a jew though that’s fucking crazy<br>that makes it easy to murder you guys no no no shit we could<br>have a sinner standing you actually haven’t thought this out<br>we’ll have some our bodies we can get them on your bodies<br>yeah but you if you’re dead but if i just poison that cops<br>can’t give you an autopsy yeah<br>but because i just we just poisoned that<br>but now they’re not going to know<br>what’s all those drinking it what’s that monster on his neck<br>suicide<br>weird naked choked himself down<br>yeah it was it<br>that’s the story i’m sticking to it<br>yeah no autopsies i think there are certain situations where<br>they say if they’re afraid it might be let go<br>congenitive is that a word<br>heart disease or like the kids should know<br>if i should get treated for it congenital<br>i don’t know then they’ll they’ll allow me<br>i don’t know but they still<br>let’s go for that<br>but not just randomly to figure out what the cause of death is<br>still like he’s dead yeah but<br>anytime at you know a young actress dies and there’s medication<br>around there’s a lot of money<br>they do automatically do it no matter what<br>whatever somebody says don’t yeah or whatever my diet<br>don’t waste the money<br>people come on this is depressing change the topic<br>hey do you guys like cats<br>what do you think about oprah she’s so generous yeah<br>no i do paparazzi don’t give a shit about me<br>someone asked me if paparazzi chased me<br>they would make zero dollars off of my pictures<br>there’s no benefit and take a picture of me you have to stay<br>just under that level of fame<br>you have to stay in the level<br>of fame where nobody comes to fuck<br>so you can still work and<br>you don’t have to worry about your bills<br>and you can go out to dinner<br>but you don’t want to don’t get crazy<br>the best artist renders easy at that vince vaughn<br>while west convey tour like premiere<br>and then<br>there’s a party like across the street at some hip club<br>whatever on hollywood and<br>so we leave and all the popular outs there waiting<br>for vince vaughn and justin long and stuff<br>immediately degenerates or fucking piece of shit you know<br>he’s like giving it to him<br>and they were like hey the guy from palms it was oh hey<br>yeah that’s me everybody how are you<br>oh no<br>that’s fine<br>that’s hilarious yeah you know

you know<br>i mean i always he was talking about it sexually<br>he was talking about friends you know like<br>his acquaintances that he has a very varied life<br>but you know he gotta appreciate that yeah<br>dudes getting twenty year olds and he’s fucking seventy<br>that’s how badass he is<br>that’s pretty crazy right<br>he’s defined nature with his fame<br>with his ability to pretend it overcomes the natural<br>his ability<br>to pretend and his money have done he should be john<br>in a natural world<br>he’s done with sex like that’s not yeah well<br>maybe he spends a companion his age<br>especially if there was no viagra yeah<br>you know i mean if there was no viagra<br>that would take a lot of dudes out of the game<br>take a lot of dudes out of the game a lot of old rich dudes<br>feel like what’s the fucking point<br>you know but right now they can<br>you know brian holtzman had to joke about that<br>now i like that because now<br>these young whores have to fuck these old men<br>and he goes and that is that sperm is like paint that’s been<br>in their basement for like a year you know that paintwork<br>it’s not a fresh product lead<br>he’s hilarious<br>it’s not quite called the sparkle he picked out<br>that’s it yeah that’s it<br>he’s one of those dudes<br>there’s a few dudes that over the course of<br>doing stand up comedy<br>that i’ve always gone how the fuck did that guy not make it<br>he’s one of them right<br>yeah he’s so good<br>so funny brian holtsman if you ever at the comedy store in la<br>that’s where brian<br>where he works out if you call the comedy store<br>call the commy store and ask when brian holton’s gonna be up<br>especially if something goes down the news<br>like i guaranteeing he’s got some fuck up<br>five minutes on haiti

tried to do it again<br>it wasn’t quite as good<br>just an awesome set about that<br>and then<br>nine eleven happened mitsy wouldn’t put him on<br>because we were closed<br>we were closed tuesday wednesday thursday<br>and then we opened up friday<br>saturday and she knew that he would get up and talk<br>about it<br>so she made the talent coordinator called him and said listen<br>we can’t put you on<br>like i’m sorry but it’s just yeah<br>he’s one of those guys that would take the opinion<br>most fucked up by default<br>he would automatically like go after<br>the victims and you know what did you do wrong<br>why were you in<br>that building yeah<br>what were you doing in the ass in that building<br>it’s just like<br>his takeout it would be so fucked up he went on on sunday<br>though because it opened<br>like his open night<br>and he did about fifty to fifty five minutes and it was maybe<br>one of the best sets of ever seen stanope was there watching<br>and stanope said i disagree with ninety five percent of this<br>but it’s so fucking goddamn good<br>because he’s so crazy his stance was fuck the cops<br>he goes but they’re not heroes now<br>why cause it did the job one time<br>because if i was one of the people jumping out of the building<br>i’d wait till a fucking cop is below me<br>so i could take him out too<br>this is on nine fifteen you know what everyone’s like<br>what are the crowds do when you see this<br>i don’t remember oh<br>i can be that you remember when that should drown their kids<br>yeah yeah holtzman goes<br>on stage like three days after

fucking milk<br>those kids will not be missed<br>and i went oh<br>my god i think we’re all i look too i heard there were bad kids<br>that’s one of<br>the most brutal and funny jonah people’s brains and<br>comedy is geared<br>because in my brain<br>just you know it’s weird how you fall into whatever<br>style of comedy<br>like i would never even think about to go that way yeah yeah<br>his rifle is on things but meanwhile he’s really friendly<br>like if he talked to him like offstage<br>like he’s not a dark guy at all he’s very nice<br>he always always<br>go get me coke when i was working the cover booth<br>like i did this<br>one coke called classic from the back<br>i was like max man i need to go back<br>get it and bring it back<br>i miss that dude<br>this is the factory sometimes too is he yeah<br>i gotta i got to go sometime<br>i had to find out when he’s playing and go performing<br>and he was always so cool<br>he’s so nice he is at the factor sometimes<br>he was always such a nice guy<br>there was one time when i got banned<br>where polly band me for like a weekend<br>and halstein was so nice about it what did he say about it<br>polybammy for a weekend because i got mad at him<br>because you got mad at him yeah<br>him and dean tried to corner me about something<br>and i told him he was a fucking idiot and that<br>he doesn’t appreciate the comedians that i’m not<br>working for him<br>it’s one right after<br>the minding the store came out<br>it was like he all the sudden was running the kami store<br>it was all sudden you know<br>it wasn’t like just a tv show anymore now<br>because the commerce store we’ve always done for free<br>you know i always not only did i work there for free<br>but i<br>donate all that when they had when they were giving me checks<br>they gave me like thousands of dollars for the checks<br>and i never cashed them<br>because i always knew that they were hurting for cash<br>so when it came time to do their taxes<br>i had to donate all that money back to them<br>and i paid for the sound system<br>i mean i treated that place like it was our place<br>you know it was a place<br>for comics the mics were cutting out<br>and that sound that sounds like crackly and rogan<br>bought it was like fuck<br>it just we gotta fix this i got that top of the line shit<br>i went and got the top of the line<br>cd recorder so dudes could make cds<br>and i put it all in there out of my own money because<br>just for love of the club<br>and then all sudden pollies running it i’m like man<br>i ain’t working for free for you<br>you know i’ll do it all for your mom but for you<br>no that’s battle now but who gets the store<br>i think he won corps polly won yeah<br>i think his brother gave up that’s what i heard<br>all these brothers<br>i’ve all the years i’ve lived here i think i’ve been in there<br>one time really<br>and i look great i’ve been in<br>that bar area just hanging i went with<br>some comic but i don’t think i’ve ever met a hundred stage here<br>i walked by yesterday he was like i think i’ve been here four<br>times i never<br>i’ve<br>so crazy not all careers<br>never really been performing in los angeles<br>that’s what that’s what he was saying yeah<br>but you’ve done sexy improv i’ve seen you again yeah<br>the improv and then i think<br>i think i’m banned from the laugh factory<br>which too we were talking about guns<br>and the dude owns it’s a real pacifist<br>and jamie jamie banned you for talking about guns yeah<br>that i was on for the next week and then<br>i got call and said no you got called<br>they didn’t just not give his thought no i called like<br>whoever don’t like so tomorrow was so good yeah no<br>i got asked and then<br>because<br>you talk about guns non stage where was all stage conversation<br>and it’s like he’s like<br>wait you have gun damage you want to kill people i’m like<br>no i enjoy shooting you have gun yeah i<br>enjoy shooting them but if they came in my house then<br>then i killed them listen<br>jamie quit worrying about what comics have in their house<br>and yes<br>more than introducing little kids than michael jackson oh<br>constantly it’s like that’s a way bigger problem<br>i’m having a locked gun in this house<br>he’s not joking around he’s not joking around<br>jamie was introducing<br>children that are on the make a wish foundation<br>right was a make a wish or something yes<br>kids are sick<br>he was introducing them to michael jacks you say introducing<br>i say pimping<br>what’s the difference buddy<br>buddy he’s not pimping<br>he’s genius buddy he does not want to fuck to ask<br>i think i don’t think that<br>i didn’t do anything i don’t think michael jackson<br>fuck those kids<br>because i think where are the bodies<br>there would be not just one kitty fucked he’d be fucking<br>hundreds i think he probably fucked eight to ten<br>i don’t think he did i think it<br>i think it’s much more likely that we talked about this before<br>right yeah<br>i think it’s much more likely that he’s just<br>completely fucked up<br>and was molested when he was a kid and abused<br>and he grew up in the public eye<br>and he grew up as a baby and like being famous and just<br>he’d already go back to drug user<br>i believe in the power of the huge rumors and i think he’ll do<br>what about the terrible in the ass do you believe that one<br>i’m going to just because of that theory<br>what about what everybody says to point some other gay<br>kids killed<br>mikey from life syrup because he saw him without his

for a long time well<br>then the size got to be that<br>when i would sit down<br>i’d get wet it would<br>get dunked into the water and a lot of toilets<br>including my own here<br>and so i would have

the store you gotta do something<br>you gotta figure out<br>you gotta pound on walls<br>in the army and they’re like the forties and fifties and sixties<br>where people grew up in small towns had never<br>seen they just thought they were weird for these feelings<br>but they didn’t know<br>the ones that grew up in new york<br>and i like obviously i know about gaze so the ones who grew up<br>and then they go to the army<br>all the time they find other gaze and they find each other<br>and say oh<br>well in the army apparently that’s like a real problem<br>especially in the navy when dudes are on boats<br>there was a dude<br>that we knew that was going away to the navy<br>his bro the little brother was going away to the navy<br>we’re all sitting around eaten with them<br>and i just as a

to god races wow<br>i mean how many people was he coming in contact with<br>even though the navy’s gigantic that’s that’s a big number<br>if it’s a few thousand<br>still fuck<br>do you ever come close to join in the military or anything<br>yeah i had<br>a recruiter show up at the grocery store i worked at<br>it was for the air force i thought of it oh<br>he went to my high school and then i remember him<br>how old is that yeah like seventeen eighteen<br>and then when i wrestled in high school then he<br>this recruit i don’t know if he saw our heavyweight and goes yes<br>i’m looking for john hefron and then<br>this guy started laughing he’s like<br>he’s too small because that when i was in high school<br>i was maybe five six hundred<br>i think i wrestled the hundred five pounds okay<br>so i didn’t grow to laugh like three years one of five<br>one or five is<br>not even a real wait as you want i wrestle<br>i know right<br>a hundred five pounds like yeah you’re pretty smart yeah<br>yeah<br>you just say you would fuck john if he was a hundred pounds<br>i would have to see a picture<br>when were you thinking about join the military at the same time<br>seventeen eighteen it was<br>kind of interesting<br>instead of college or like fuck it yeah<br>i was gonna go for college<br>like it looks like a national guard i was like you can get paid<br>and i had to put up some cones<br>during a flood or something i really want to be<br>five five<br>do you remember<br>that’s the post administration changed all that bulls yeah<br>the national guard used to be a safe way to not go<br>to war to war<br>and you’re helping people you’re still getting money<br>collective duty and they split families up and it’s<br>well even look if you look at rambo<br>remember it was all national guard guys went after rambo<br>and the whole movie was making fun of these national guard guys<br>like yeah<br>they don’t know how to do anything<br>hey i gotta get back to the store<br>and now the natural guard guys are as badasses anyone else yes<br>a dude i do jujitsu with and he<br>was in the army reserve for twenty years<br>and twenty days left in his twenty year tour<br>twenty years<br>twenty days left they sent him to iraq for a year and a half<br>so if they start before that your time is over<br>you can just<br>lock you in it doesn’t matter and they can bring you back<br>they can bring you back anytime they want they recall you<br>they’re hurting so bad nowadays<br>that i’m surprised they’re not just like oh<br>you’re an eagle scout you gotta get a fucking iraq<br>i think it’s actually<br>not about you talk to there’s a lot of dude to go over there<br>because they think they’re doing the right thing<br>there’s a lot of dudes like pat tilman<br>due to join the army<br>and join the name<br>they think<br>they’re doing it to protect this great country especially<br>then in like two thousand one<br>two thousand two people once they get in<br>then they realize you’re getting fucked<br>and that’s what happened with patelman<br>i mean he was a huge critic as was his brother of<br>how fucked up things are over an iraq in afghanistan<br>and you know<br>obviously one up killing<br>they killed friendly fire<br>i remember a year ago<br>i went out i did a show and it got back to hotel room<br>and i googled oldest ages to join an army<br>i was like you’d be old as fuck right nah he bumped it up three<br>two forty three but that’s like twenty years longer than<br>that would you be enlisted there or no you do it no straight to<br>officer corps i heard a couple things one<br>they would like say i joined at you know forty<br>they give me a job that and take<br>a nineteen year old all that job<br>in the throw that man nineteen year old office line<br>so like the older guys is like<br>but i know one my wife’s friend<br>she’s in arbone ranger<br>she said she has<br>privates in her thing that are like thirty seven<br>thirty eight years old<br>private you know just<br>guys that are<br>dudes man that have no fucking money<br>and they don’t have anything<br>in their town<br>and there’s no option<br>like something to do what’s the difference<br>you’re taking care of the rescue you’re gonna go to war<br>ari’s like oh yeah now<br>it’d be a major problem<br>i’m tired of general it’s like i don’t know<br>we’ve been at war for eight years dude<br>nas it’s two thousand way yeah yeah<br>yeah we’ve been at war for eight years<br>man joining the military for the last decade is<br>but no joke yeah<br>you know it’s just<br>what the fuck man<br>it’s when i was a kid vietnam ended<br>when i was a little boy<br>and i remember thinking very clearly that oh<br>this is a good thing cause now<br>there’s not gonna be any more war<br>like obviously<br>everybody hates war is we’re never gonna go to war again<br>and then when i was like twenty one was the first golf war<br>me and my buddy<br>jimmy detilio were sit we had an apartment together<br>and waltham massachusetts so ethnic it was athenatolio<br>hanging out waltham<br>and we’re sitting in front of the tv<br>and the fucking the first strike happened<br>and they showed the missiles coming in the bombs going up<br>and i was like holy shit<br>and we<br>me and jimmy watched it like we were watching a football game<br>we were like dude we’re at war<br>holy shit i remember being in college<br>then and the two guys i lived with were all<br>reservist and then they got called up<br>so they were probably twenty twenty<br>one years old twenty two<br>got call up and went down to<br>they were gonna start to help train<br>at the time<br>everybody was like just give me a draft just give me a draft<br>so<br>we all thought cause we were that at that age or twenty twenty<br>one we’re like<br>holy crap we’re going yeah<br>oh yeah that was a serious talk about yeah yeah<br>so scary man i remember when the first golf war happened<br>we’re practicing a basketball<br>and it was the open night with some play<br>some high school play and someone came in like the play bomb<br>the plane<br>the planes bomb but i just got things like the play bomb<br>i was like why are you breaking up a practice with it<br>since so<br>yes i’m a little happy about it<br>yeah the whole thing is so surreal<br>i got woken up<br>i don’t remember who woke me up<br>somebody woke me up call being told me that<br>america’s under attack yeah<br>that’s what i said america’s under attack<br>and i was like what turn the news america’s under attack<br>and we just are so removed<br>from all the shit that goes on in the rest of the world<br>we are so removed from what war really is unless<br>you talk to someone<br>who’s actually been over there and come back<br>and they have a very<br>different opinion of it<br>but we’re so fucking removed from it over here when i saw that<br>shit on tv i was like what really<br>like this isn’t a movie<br>i was like your heart starts beating faster it’s like<br>all of a sudden<br>this team you’re on<br>is under attack<br>you know i mean it’s not you<br>but it’s like we’re all in this team together<br>and then you don’t think<br>about that through your day to day life<br>you can say you’re happy to be an american<br>shit and you believe in democracy and i’m a republican<br>but you don’t really<br>realize you’re on some team<br>until team’s attack right<br>and then you like so dudes that did nothing<br>dudes who didn’t know these dudes came over and killed them<br>just because they were living on this spark yeah<br>they were living in this<br>patch of dirt so people were killing them<br>that’s it i thought that was only movie shit<br>my brother’s over there now<br>is he up can’t stand he just got called up again oh my god yeah<br>that’s what happens<br>when you go through a tour<br>if you sign up for the military<br>dick cheney instituted some new situation where they can just<br>kind of keep bringing you back<br>police deal in active reserve<br>so he knew he was eventually called up again<br>but when they<br>were in situation<br>where people<br>were done their tours and they were bringing them back yeah<br>oh randall masker how long are you gonna ask the same question<br>over and over and over again<br>there’s some dude asking a question over and over again<br>i’ve seen it ten times you just rewarded him joe<br>who gets more women<br>why are you reading it huh just rewarding him<br>no i just he’s still doing<br>so<br>all right well<br>we’ll yeah when people ignore you<br>sometimes you ever make a joke like in public and nobody laughs<br>and then you hear somebody like<br>make the same joke again because they assume nobody heard them<br>it’s like dude<br>look at the response and fucking<br>take that to mean<br>they didn’t find it funny<br>the worst that someone thinks you<br>weren’t listening and they say it again yeah<br>one that means it’s not in the moment<br>just trying to make this job<br>this guy says all the branches other<br>than the army are overloaded actually<br>no i believe that now<br>now i think he’s probably telling truth<br>i would think that in this economy i would there’s a lot yeah<br>a lot of people are it’s a lot higher than<br>look at what was it how long two years ago new rollins you know<br>we didn’t have enough people to sit in there<br>you know<br>two years ago wasn’t it wasn’t it a lot more than two years ago<br>when was katrina<br>what year was that<br>maybe it was longer<br>cause that was when i first heard about kanye west<br>when he was like george bush hates black people<br>that was my favorite<br>was michael myers reaction because he’s just a hollywood guy ooh<br>i do not want to be associated with you just so uncomfortable<br>i know he got so i mean that was like one of the blackest<br>most dangerous things and it was like<br>why am i in this picture<br>george bush does not like black people<br>george book hates black people<br>right you say hazer does not like<br>he said hates black people hates yeah<br>he said hates you just hates black people yeah<br>you know why why is that guy still on tv that’s fine<br>but now he’s on tv because<br>he’s a douchebag<br>and because people are looking for him to do something wrong<br>he’s like his face is gonna be on tv<br>is evolved it used to be like here’s this young artist<br>now it’s like this guy’s such a cock like having<br>close to the camera it’s probably up again do something<br>stupid never to hate him<br>and it’ll get you million hits on youtube<br>you know like when he took that microphone away from that girl<br>he’ll be hated forever<br>you don’t do that what was even worse was his<br>fake apology on leno later he’s trying to work up tiers<br>but he couldn’t quite do it oh<br>he’s so weak and he was just<br>saying he’s gonna take a step back<br>and he’s not gonna work on some show he’s gonna<br>let’s just shut the fuck up<br>my favorite is one that he says just please just let me be great<br>just let me be great boys<br>george boys doesn’t care about black people doesn’t care yeah<br>that’s what i thought it was<br>thank you aradder boy<br>yeah hate is a very strong word<br>hate my admires flinch and pee a little<br>made a little dribble go<br>i just could ruin my career<br>what happened to that dude mike myers yeah<br>it was they’re actually making a new awesome powers movie yeah<br>the last movie let it die awful that last movie was deaf<br>tarantino put him in<br>put him in gloria’s bastard and it was horrible<br>it was so like why is this<br>it was weird because it wasn’t being funny<br>so then it’s like why would you put clearly<br>someone who’s known as a<br>comedic actor<br>we ate michael miles<br>did that last movie the wrong way was like dude<br>you’re doing the same movie but<br>yeah but it’s an indian so i married next mother wasn’t bad<br>cuz he wasn’t overdue<br>he was just like a little bit like<br>i never saw that that’s a great movie ten years ago<br>people are asking to take a take a break why<br>because we’ve been on straight for a while<br>what does that mean<br>they can’t leave the fucking screens they don’t<br>break the bathroom when they get up well<br>we’re<br>gonna answer we’re done we’re done because it’s four thirty<br>and i have to<br>do some sort of an interview with some people in australia<br>for a gig i’m doing in australia<br>just i’m not trying to drop names<br>i’m saying i’m doing it in australia<br>checking it into national style like my boy soldier<br>boy holler what happened to that guy<br>i thought this is a knife guy oh yeah<br>he got as famous as was possible for him<br>yes<br>he was huge somebody just made a reference paul hogan right yeah<br>was that a goblin<br>was that a family guy or simpson<br>just made a reference about him<br>so i want to get hugely famous like that guy from crocodile<br>hunter and then not crocodile crocodile dundee yeah<br>and then not famous at all like that guy from crocodile dundee<br>yeah how weird is that it was gone<br>i was doing movies and shit i took his millions and left<br>yeah you know what it did<br>just go to the hollywood<br>no i think we got sick of them as a pastry<br>but i think people just we only did two crocodile dundees<br>and then no other movies didn’t try to like<br>being someone else’s film yeah<br>we didn’t see him in a romantic comedy you don’t think you want<br>you know you’re the crocodile guy<br>they must have lost some money on his movie<br>and said fuck him<br>have you seen the preview for the new mcgruger movie<br>you’re making a whole movie about it<br>you may have a whole movie coming out and usually<br>snl<br>mcgruver mcgruger it’s a take<br>on saturday live<br>there’s a movie and they’re making a movie<br>and they have the new preview<br>that just came out<br>and the funny thing about snl<br>movies is that they usually always<br>have the best parts in the preview<br>there’s not one part in this one that looks good you guys<br>it’s that is the worst<br>when you go to a preview and you just sit there and go oh<br>what the fuck are they doing<br>why would someone<br>like promote them yeah<br>there’s nothing worse than bad comic because at least bad dramas<br>hilarious you know<br>bad drama like show girls or something like that those are<br>genuinely funny movies<br>you know i got some<br>left behinds they’re<br>the rapture videos that that fucking<br>kirk camera dude makes holy shit are they awesome<br>they’re so good they’re so beautifully stupid<br>watching kirk camera<br>get owned on youtube is one of my favorite pastimes he’s so dumb<br>i saw kirk karen movie<br>did you really the one who’s on debate team<br>i don’t remember what it was but it was like a group date<br>on a lever and a few other people<br>we got driven there<br>it was a debate movie<br>and i remember the big climax at the end was like<br>because some teacher taught them into clear<br>move to the rest of the movie that<br>he sounded like he was being real but he really wasn’t<br>and then later was like are you serious about that yeah i was<br>i guarantee you<br>kurt cameron loves the cock<br>i guarantee you he loves the cock<br>there’s no doubt about there’s no way he’s that crazy gung ho<br>jesus the rapture no sin no masturbation no thus<br>fucking gay as the day is on<br>that’s what you know what i think is relighting it with every<br>fiber of his being<br>trying to stay in the straight and narrow and<br>like girls and nywan who just wants fucking cough<br>hot mouth i just said that<br>hershel walker was talking about when you doing his fight<br>uh huh strike voice and he said he doesn’t masturbate yeah<br>but he’s crazy<br>hershel walker has got like a split personality disorder yes<br>i heard it was trauma related i thought it was trauma related<br>he said that like he didn’t forget<br>his highest metrophy like he’s got all these different<br>well dude<br>think about how many times i got must have had concussions<br>i don’t know if he’s a big concussion got it though<br>he plays football<br>everybody gets concussions play football right<br>quarterbacks get it no<br>a quarterback<br>like who’s had the most it would be like eight ever<br>but that’s quarterback to take blindside hits all the time<br>who was standing there with somebody fucking crushed them<br>helmet to helmos yeah<br>but anytime you get hit okay<br>even if you’re not getting a concussion<br>you’re getting fucking rattled<br>even if you get up<br>and you get back up when you get smashed into<br>by some giant dude who’s running full clip<br>even if you don’t go out<br>and even if you don’t have a concussion where<br>your pupils are dilated<br>you got some braid damage sun you just got jarred<br>you know that’s reality<br>and when you do that shit over and over and over again<br>the football is one of the most dangerous i saw<br>ben rothasburger last week<br>no what about ben rothsburger<br>was there a big quarterback whoever it was oh<br>kurt warner who threw it in reception went to make a tackle<br>and then he just got wine sided<br>and you see him on the ground with this trainer’s over him<br>and he’s like talking<br>but you can clearly see he’s not making any sense he’s like<br>no no i mow the<br>and you’re like they’re like our stay stay<br>that’s nuts i got a lot of wonky cushion once caught a<br>danny bounded yuchi hit me in the back of the head<br>where it’s barn<br>not

dropped and<br>what were you thinking how badly<br>we heard when he got dropped he goes i got dropped<br>he didn’t yeah when it came on it oh wow<br>i did it like his reaction was so real tim sylvia<br>when he fought<br>what’s his name randy couture when tim sylvia<br>got cracked in the first round<br>he woke up going into the fourth round yeah<br>he didn’t know what rattle was he thought the second round<br>was the fourth round<br>or he thought the fourth round was the second round<br>it was awkward<br>so he missed two rounds or the<br>fifth i think it might have been the fifth<br>because they told them like this is the last round he was like<br>what the last<br>round like he thought it was like the second round<br>like he was gone<br>he was fighting on autopilot<br>it’s just your party your body try not to die<br>you know just random nerves just randomly thrown blasted<br>i love like striking training i love like hitting the pad<br>and hitting the bag<br>and spawn with somebody you can trust as fun yeah<br>if you can find that guy that knows seventy percent<br>is seventy percent<br>you’re seventy months you in the face recently in<br>your clock problem i got a clock yeah<br>same thing that’s why i like i enjoy drink like you said<br>we’re doing<br>literally i go let’s go forty percent because i got to<br>and if you know<br>people don’t know when you do like striking spawn<br>the whole deal is that you don’t hit each other hard you look<br>you hit each other like<br>a little bit but you don’t try to knock each other out yes<br>so i’m like and my promise is<br>i don’t get in close enough so i told the guy<br>let’s go forty that way if i do get drilled right in the face<br>it’s not gonna<br>so then i throw a kick<br>but i’m throwing a kick at forty percent<br>which means any little kick could grab that kick yeah<br>it’s not going fast<br>so he swoops it grabs it and then<br>blast punches as hard as he could<br>after he catches my foot and then i’m just<br>laying there i want yeah that’s what i’m gonna do more jujitsu<br>because the worst thing<br>it’s gonna happen to me is somebody’s gonna<br>tap me out yes i mean that could be that fluke weird<br>but it’s more of a gent not a gentleman’s board it’s just<br>more technical<br>it’s more technically what happened is i go like that<br>and i’m not going man<br>are you just weird plant we’re<br>drilled in the face let’s slow down good guys don’t hurt you<br>good guys are the least you have to worry about like with a guy<br>like eddie if he gets your arm he’s gonna have full<br>control he’s not gonna pull it back and snap it<br>you gotta worry about strong<br>blue belts that are just starting to learn how to tap people<br>those are the ones<br>you know or you know like they just<br>real hyper aggressive and they don’t know how to relax yet or<br>super powerful white belts<br>who just learn and moves<br>most will get its bruises all<br>over your fucking hair when you spar<br>somebody especially<br>like if i find a place wherever i’m performing<br>that’s a better story for them yeah<br>his dean knocked out the comic that was<br>that’s a way better story than<br>hey i want to work on getting inside do you mind if i<br>i’m going to go to some places that you go to<br>and people don’t try to do that at all<br>like when i want to amal eastern’s place in<br>boulder<br>when i moved there and i started training there<br>people couldn’t have been nature<br>yeah everybody was cool<br>there was no assholes<br>there was no aggro dudes no one trying to tap<br>you no one getting crazy<br>i mean they were trying to tap you but they<br>weren’t they weren’t trying to crash on<br>you know they were just rolling it was it’s<br>it’s all from how cool the instructor is<br>the instructor is cool that the people are cool like<br>eddie’s so friendly<br>and so relaxed and so<br>cool to everybody that everybody in the whole gym<br>carries that friendly relaxed attitude<br>you know you go to like john jocks the same thing<br>but john jock’s a real nice guy<br>so everybody there’s nice and he was<br>so high there<br>that he started talking<br>and he wanted to hand it and then i was like i wonder if<br>and then you see<br>look at what laughing like he’s gone<br>you got so high you spent the first<br>five minutes of class<br>talking about some history channel documentary on ufos<br>the first five minutes like dude they got scientists man<br>they got nasa nasa people<br>man she’s going down<br>she’s like dude it’s on the history channel shit’s going down<br>i’m like how high are you right now<br>often you do dude once once to one point five times a week<br>we still have tea<br>even that once yeah<br>get you thinking about it i just get so mad<br>at myself like i’ll go<br>and you learn some stuff and then you come back<br>and you just hold somebody going i used to remember something<br>i don’t remember the and then try to hold them more<br>you gotta just be like running<br>you just stand on<br>you can take a couple of weeks off and you try to do your act<br>like how’s this go<br>you don’t even remember your bets you have to like review your<br>recordings i forgot a shit i took extended period off<br>and i forgot a shit and i was like yeah<br>i know i can do something here i don’t have any idea yeah<br>you forget a lot of shit<br>i forgot completely forgot how to do this<br>this is this<br>move to break the arm bar loose called the silverado<br>it’s my favorite move and i was a purple belt i<br>completely forgot about it right<br>reviewing it the other night i’m like oh yeah it’s there<br>and that’s how it goes in<br>you know<br>i forgot how to do it but it was like one of my favorite moves<br>it’s weird jujitsus<br>there’s so many moves that’s the crazy thing about it is<br>it’s<br>do you think it’s not matched right you think<br>year from now some guy would do something that<br>comes off a lot of people do it yeah<br>so that’s based on what you do<br>but then no one has ever thought to defend this movie because it<br>has been invented<br>so once it does get invented<br>then you’ve got to have a counter<br>there’s this new move that dudes have been doing<br>real recently called the japanese necktie<br>and it’s just come out<br>like i think iogi was the first person to do it<br>and in the groove yeah<br>it’s no japanese necktie is like a it’s sort of like a doris<br>but you grab it<br>you grab it with a gable<br>grip when you turn the guy’s head up towards<br>his chest<br>and you have your chest pinned on him it’s fucking nasty<br>it’s one of the bed and it’s new<br>it’s like how did the one know this before right right<br>yeah people are in this position<br>all the time they’re trying to get the dogs choke<br>but really there’s even better choke that’s right there<br>as soon<br>as you lock up that gable grip and you get on top of a guy<br>you tuck it under<br>and you’re bending his fucking neck towards his chest<br>your chest is on top of his head he’s got no air no blood<br>whenever we do those drills and it’s those cranks oh<br>i always pretend like we have an odd number of people<br>in the class that i don’t have partner no<br>you should do it man<br>it’s gonna hurt yeah but you do it anyway you gotta relax<br>just let them let them yank your nicara<br>it’s such a small difference between fine and serious pain<br>yeah but you gotta get used to that<br>you know no one’s gonna hurt you doing that you know<br>but it’s gonna be uncomfortable<br>but that move is it’s so important to learn how<br>where it comes on<br>because like the japanese necktie comes on so quick<br>the peruvian necktie too it’s like<br>you’re going like this and then you’re just<br>jumping back and hopefully don’t go too far<br>but it’s a spazzy move it’s awesome move<br>the proving nekti ended<br>japanese necktie both of them are the shit<br>they fucked you up man<br>it’s a terrible position to be in<br>i think the japanese necktie’s even well<br>proving is pretty badass too<br>in the proving you got your weight on top of them always<br>the japanese nectar you’re kind of like on the side<br>and hooking it<br>but it doesn’t matter it’s so good<br>such a powerful move like that<br>wow i think we’re done do you agree brian<br>i was just thinking of japanese people<br>i’m like have i ever seen a japanese guy wearing it<br>well what about that fucking japanese video game<br>that video that you posted<br>maybe we should end with that<br>because that is the most bizarre fucking thing<br>i think i’ve ever seen on the internet<br>there’s some crazy japanese video game<br>that’s like these two muscle bound gay guys were in diapers<br>and they’re a human bicycle<br>and they’re riding on the road and they’re<br>getting chased and<br>i mean it is<br>one of the gayest weirdest things deafenies lead the lead<br>the league in weirdness<br>they’re so strange do you know if people don’t know<br>there’s like you can go to vending machines in japan you can<br>buy use pannings<br>like that’s real<br>yeah you go places they sell used panties<br>why couldn’t we up on one other there<br>because you open one of those here<br>just all you do<br>is get a girl to put it on real quick throw it in a bag in this<br>yeah<br>i think you have to have enough people that are because i think<br>maybe because<br>i should have different levels you have different levels one<br>the girl wears it all day<br>that’s the primo<br>she doesn’t change your panties all day<br>no shower in the morning no shower she goes to the gym<br>and you get those stinky sweaty funky<br>moose<br>knuckle underwears i think you missed an opportunity for the<br>joe rogan fanny pack<br>i’m gonna make a line<br>and i was already thinking about your fashion show<br>i’m making fanny packs<br>and then how you use panty pack well<br>call him like rogan<br>i mean you could probably get it so<br>instead of its fanny pack it’s oh you want to<br>row i mean there’s some huge yeah<br>people’s<br>balls and people think i’m kidding about the fanny pack thing<br>you see me at the airport<br>i always have one of those things you should<br>shape a fanny pack like a<br>skull<br>like a redimensional skull you can get a little crazy with it<br>it does it it’s overhead<br>compartment for your junk you know<br>you’re setting the sky’s a limit on danny petty there’s so<br>i mean they’re really<br>it’s a huge omen<br>and you’re a cryptical so useful impacts the shit gay<br>and then i could see fighters entering<br>will that be a little bit of a thing<br>but you’ll sponsor box<br>impression<br>and after seeing the jew clam what’s going to shock us<br>well this video we’re going to show you is now<br>shocking is the juke clan this is actually<br>i gotta be goodbye everybody<br>this is actually funny so always gonna be<br>here we’ll turn off the webcam
