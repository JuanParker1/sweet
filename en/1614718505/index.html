happen<br>here we go<br>we’re here ladies and gentlemen we’re live<br>we’ve done it faster this time than ever<br>we’re getting better at it<br>less fuck ups less hiccups<br>live from the compound<br>we started a little bit late today<br>though it was all my fault<br>brian was rocked and locked and loaded this time<br>I just fucked up<br>I was tired<br>because I had to do the kevin and bean show<br>this morning and how to get up early<br>because I have to elite my house is<br>kind of far from them<br>what the fuck people<br>what’s going down bitches<br>happy new year<br>brian is all in a tizzy about the goddamn ipad<br>and me I twittered<br>that I don’t need an ipad because I’m a fucking man<br>and I can carry a goddamn backpack with a laptop<br>and I don’t complain like a little bitch<br>and this seems like it’s got less shit than a laptop<br>if you’re gonna go like an airplane or something<br>somewhere<br>you want a fucking laptop you want to be able to<br>get on the computer<br>you want to be able to<br>send someone to real goddamn email attach something<br>to it and send a real link<br>easy copy and paste old school<br>you don’t want some nutty fucking finger things<br>you have to shut up<br>I want a fucking laptop and it’s not heavy I<br>can take this goddamn thing anywhere<br>they’re so small<br>now that I mean that the thin and the light<br>this is the seventeen inch<br>macbook this thing is it’s not heavy<br>you put it in a backpack you’re fine<br>i don’t need a fucking ipad brian<br>well see i think that’s the problem with<br>can everyone hear us okay<br>before we start getting really into it<br>yeah is the microphone about<br>where we are not a well polished machine<br>yeah gentlemen now<br>okay<br>where’s the broadcast over time<br>here I’ll see if<br>I’ll see if we can hear ourselves<br>this is if this was like real tv we be fine<br>I’ll see if we can hear ourselves are we on tv<br>yeah we’re good<br>okay okay<br>so here’s the thing about that the whole<br>tablet now the problem with<br>the whole thing is that steve jobs pretty much<br>just bash netbooks at the beginning of the<br>the thing so it really<br>set a nerve with a lot of people<br>meaning people are like what nipple spender<br>so he’s doing this in his speech in his speech<br>I’m not that much of a fan boy<br>I’m not gonna sit and watch you strut around and talk<br>about your fucking computer<br>I enjoy your stuff<br>I think your iphone is a goddamn work of art<br>amazing horizon<br>you know had it<br>it would be the<br>greatest phone in the history of the universe<br>but I can’t use it as a phone I<br>use it to me I carry two phones<br>I carry a blackberry unverized<br>and that’s a fucking phone<br>I can call people<br>it sucks it’s a terrible phone<br>it’s like a drunk iphone<br>like when you compare the two of them together<br>there’s no comparison<br>like sometimes I can say if I call you<br>and I have a little picture for your face<br>when I call you<br>and I go to call somebody else<br>when I start calling somebody else<br>your picture will show up<br>and then it’ll change<br>so it’s like the things like oh macaon<br>it’s like it’s dumb it’s a dumb phone<br>it’s like it does what you want to<br>but it takes a couple extra seconds and it stumbles<br>it’s storm too<br>yeah the storm too<br>yeah the screen is awesome<br>it’s a nice big ass screen and<br>I like that and the touch screen is not too bad<br>it’s pretty easy to type that even<br>this way in landscape mode<br>it’s good it’s like it’s weird<br>it gives you like a little feedback<br>which really isn’t necessary<br>but it’s not bad<br>and as a phone it’s great<br>but compared to the iphone<br>what just getting on the web is just like<br>like you’re doing it in an old wooden car<br>you know it’s just so clunky and stupid and zoom<br>okay scroll this way and oh come on really well<br>you’re saying is<br>the best part about the iphone is probably<br>internet and the worst<br>part is the worst part is atm<br>clearly I don’t mind<br>making calls on them making calls on his badass<br>just that I just phone atp is just terrible<br>it might be that are in somebody’s town you know<br>they got more atnt towers more gsm towers so they took<br>the best part of the iphone and made it<br>a little bit bigger<br>yeah and they got rid of like<br>what no camera<br>what the fuck well here’s the whole thing about this<br>what I’m thinking now is I’m thinking all right<br>I like my iphone but I only<br>use it because at once in a while I want something<br>small to surf the net and do basic shit weight<br>oh right listen to this<br>say you’re in a Starbucks<br>and some dude comes in and start spraying the place<br>right okay and you want to be taking video right<br>and you’re on your little ipad<br>thinking you’re a genius sipping on your lips<br>but you have two cameras you don’t have shit you not me<br>you’re just a regular dude who just<br>has an I have your digital camera<br>you have just<br>has an ipad in a blackberry because he’s not sold on<br>apple blackberry’s online<br>he’s online right there and he wants to get online<br>with his ipad and take video<br>and scream it to yue stream<br>this happening and he can’t do it<br>because the ipad’s a piece of shit<br>okay well listen have a camera well<br>listen now<br>one of the things that he said in his speech<br>that’s logic now can’t argue that<br>here’s my argument<br>he said during the speech that it has a port<br>that is going to have accessories to open it up to the<br>the universe of all well<br>and so imagine having a nice hd camera<br>hooked up to the bottom<br>you just have it to be streaming through Starbucks<br>like a fucking creep<br>you can’t even do it on the dl<br>everybody’s going to know<br>you’re going to be out there scanning people<br>with your little webcam<br>no what if it snapped on the front<br>so you’re on the webcam with Starbucks here<br>buddy what Starbucks well now here’s the thing<br>it gives up to have a left of a Starbucks<br>it has a thing that<br>it already has attachments for like a card reader<br>next week we’re gonna be at Starbucks<br>no we’re gonna be at the coffee bean<br>no that’s what I’m saying<br>it doesn’t have a camera<br>but yet it has an attachment that he said<br>we’ll have accessories<br>like microphones and cameras<br>put a camera on the fucking thing bitch<br>you want to be super special<br>and you want it to be the bomb<br>I think they’re trying to keep it down<br>price wise under $500 because here’s the thing<br>if you’re going to buy a book reader right now<br>you’re on amazon<br>com you’re looking at the kindle the big kindle<br>that’s $10 cheaper<br>than this thing<br>that makes a lot of sense actually and<br>it’s backlit I have a sony e reader but I read in bed<br>so when my girlfriend’s sleeping I want to read I can’t<br>I have to have a light on<br>and it can’t even just be a dim light<br>it has to be a bright light for me to read it<br>so now I got a little hip on sucker<br>yeah yeah this is right<br>and you get person to sleep right next to you right<br>especially if you got a kindle<br>like with a leather cover<br>right you put the light here<br>bam you can read right next to them<br>so this thing would be great<br>you know right there<br>married dudes talking you need right next to them<br>when I was single I’d be like<br>well I guess you can’t fuck right<br>sleep right you know<br>oh I can’t sleep while you’re reading a book<br>well maybe<br>the couch would be a better place for you to sleep<br>totally what the fuck are you talking about<br>totally<br>so that’s it like $10 more<br>wouldn’t you get that if you did have one already<br>if you were getting a book reader<br>would you get $10 more<br>would you pay for the eye tablet dude<br>that’s the best argument I’ve ever heard<br>if I had choose between<br>kindle and the ipad I would for sure take the ipad<br>and now the argument on the other side dollars yeah<br>the argument on the other side is e ink<br>is less stressful on the eyes<br>but here’s what I’m thinking is that true<br>it might be something to sell that technology<br>but here’s what I’m thinking<br>I’m on the computer 11h a day 10h a day<br>I’m doing 99% reading<br>and I’ve never gone all the turrets my foods no<br>I have noticed that<br>I think<br>well it could be awesome because I’m getting older<br>but my eyesight is not as good<br>my eyesight like reading like you say if I have to read<br>vitamin bottle it tells me<br>how many of you supposed to take right<br>I have struggle with that shit right<br>you know I have to try to focus<br>it’s not what it used to be<br>so I don’t read more than like an hour 2h<br>I’m gonna eat book anyways a day<br>and so I’m thinking if I’m on the computer 12h already<br>a day and I use 2h of that<br>look at this<br>I don’t think it’s edward kat flappo says everything<br>apple makes us perfect<br>steve jobs is god and bill gates is a nazi<br>wow that’s obviously not those are strong words<br>those are strong words<br>do you think that’s the real flappo<br>the real flappo is<br>craziest if you don’t know who he is<br>one of the craziest characters on the internet<br>he’s just<br>nutty dude from england who likes to get fucked up<br>all day and he’s got a lot of<br>money so he doesn’t have to work<br>so the dude just gets online and just<br>trolls people and fucks with them all day<br>he’s really hilarious he’s crazy<br>you could find him at your website<br>joe ribbon dot net on the forums<br>just look for flap out<br>and he just picks fights with people<br>he finds them when he just insults him over and over<br>again<br>and everybody’s discussing assholes goes in asshole<br>and yeah<br>yeah but there’s something about it that’s so endearing<br>it mean he’s really doing it for entertainment<br>he’s a character<br>he’s like an internet character<br>that’s like running through this<br>this show we’re doing and the show is the website<br>the forums and he’s like this character<br>he’s like one of the<br>like this is he won’t meet us either won’t meet us<br>he’s kind of a shutting but I understand that<br>you know I mean if you want some crazy dude just<br>stays in the internet all day<br>I wouldn’t even care what he looks like<br>I mean he could be<br>totally trolling with this whole story<br>I don’t care I just think he’s an interesting dude<br>nice to say hi<br>but he doesn’t want us to take pictures of him<br>put it online<br>because then everybody will have evidence right<br>they’ll have<br>weapons and ammunition to go against him in his<br>internet wars<br>but there’s supposedly one picture of him<br>yeah but who the fuck knows<br>you think that’s real cause if not<br>that’s a great fuck<br>he’s smiling and everything<br>but he’s never met anybody how do we know you know<br>right could be a co where could be a boyfriend girl<br>could be one of your ex girlfriends<br>this is justin<br>who the hell knows yeah we have no idea it’s a good eye<br>no idea that’s the best thing about the internet though<br>the best is meeting people though that are cool<br>yeah I have so many friends view or one of them<br>I met on the internet<br>but there’s so many people that we’ve met<br>from your message board in other places<br>that seems like a crazy thing to say<br>yeah it seems like you’re an idiot<br>what are you doing meeting fucking people<br>from your message board but<br>you know when you’re either bottom line is for real<br>it’s like you’re meeting people<br>all over the country anyway<br>when you’re doing standup<br>what<br>the difference does it make if you meet them online<br>first and wouldn’t that be smarter<br>you know like yeah<br>the only way to interact with people is<br>I mean the internet is like the greatest for that<br>like<br>there’s people that could never have relationships<br>that didn’t have any friends<br>that had nothing going on in their real life<br>but they developed like whole internet worlds man<br>quick player buddies of mine when I was like<br>seriously addicted to playing quake<br>there’s dudes that<br>lived their whole life on the internet<br>and that’s where<br>all their friendships came from and<br>you get to know people like there in<br>you know it’s it’s<br>it’s a little more<br>it sounds crazy<br>I’m saying that you meet people<br>internet but it’s really probably<br>pretty intelligent<br>girls that like used dating sites<br>they used to be thought of as losers<br>you know you’d hear but like oh her sister she’s on<br>fucking match<br>com whatever fuck it is like oh pork or what the fuck<br>didn’t he think about being a chick<br>all the fucking scumbags out there wouldn’t you want to<br>listen to them talk for a while first<br>like see what they have<br>what nutty shit they want to say in their email<br>see how they say you’re and you’re<br>do you use that apostrophe you fucking creating<br>your cave person<br>no you know I mean<br>it’s funny<br>those dating sites how many different ones they are<br>like jay date that’s for jewish people<br>they have one for the people that just have herpes<br>I forget the name of it<br>nice they have one for anything you could possibly want<br>all girls who suck magic johnson’s dick right<br>that’s funny that’s funny<br>hey listen to this guy<br>this guy says joe ever heard about reverse speech<br>everything you say says something in reverse now<br>ordinarily I would say that’s retarded bullshit<br>but I smoked a marijuana right before<br>we did this broadcast<br>and I’m like man who the hell knows<br>maybe we just don’t know that<br>in language you can reverse it<br>and it can show true intention<br>is that possible by the way your intonations and no<br>I mean I don’t think it is but<br>maybe it is what the fuck do I know<br>well you know things that are possible we’re so nutty<br>you know why do you think that<br>I mean<br>that could be just some weird side effect or speech<br>that when you reverse things it says<br>the opposite of what<br>the person really means is possible shit<br>who the fuck knows<br>the world is so nutty as it is the fact that we’re on<br>this sphere that<br>hovers around this gigantic nuclear explosion<br>it flies with the galaxy<br>everybody wants to talk about the cast of jersey shore<br>renegotiating their deal<br>I mean that’s like the No.1 conversation<br>and or how many<br>you know how many<br>more millions they’re gonna give conan o’brien at fox<br>or<br>you know how many more chicks the tiger would fuck is<br>his wife gonna get back together with him<br>it’s like we get so caught up in nonsense<br>and I’ve been trying to figure that out more and more<br>as I get older<br>like what it is<br>because it’s not just<br>I say you know people<br>I say we I get caught up in that stupid shit too<br>I was wondering what was gonna happen<br>at john when he left kate because<br>he wasn’t making any money anymore<br>and also he has to pay mad<br>alimony you know<br>because I think they probably<br>negotiate that shit when he was on a show<br>and he’d make a good money<br>but they kicked them off that show<br>and then they’re gonna sue him<br>and the poor dude you know<br>I mean he just fell apart in front of the whole world<br>1st he fell apart in front of the whole world<br>because he was married to that<br>chick who was just<br>treating him like shit<br>like it would<br>you’d watch that show him like wow that bitch is harsh<br>but then you realize<br>god damn did you imagine having<br>eight kids with that weak dude<br>that guy’s such a bitch that you would be like ugh<br>I can’t count on this motherfucker<br>come on get up you have to work<br>come on hmm just lazy and soft and dull minded<br>but he got on tv<br>and when he got on tv<br>I think girls just start saying you shouldn’t take that<br>from him she’s a bitch she doesn’t appreciate you<br>I see you on that show<br>I think you’re so hot I think you’re so cool<br>next you know he’s in there<br>oh shit I’m hot and cool<br>oh shit he didn’t realize that he himself<br>had been tricked by fame<br>just like those poor girls that fucked them<br>that’s how powerful fame is<br>fame tricks even the person that has the fame<br>it works as that tea like tequila girl<br>oh she’s the best every time<br>I hear about hers<br>every time I hear about I just get sick to my stomach<br>I’m just waiting for her baby right now<br>listen that’s all just to get you to pay attention<br>she’s a crafty little little winch<br>yeah<br>she’s gonna do a point<br>I would imagine I think she already has<br>I remember having it<br>it’s amazing when they like just totally um<br>like orchestrate sex tapes you know<br>is there any doubt that the kim kardashian sex tape<br>have you ever watched it<br>yeah yeah there’s different cameras<br>yeah I mean I will play time<br>is it really different yes yes there’s different angles<br>edited check that I knew it was dilated<br>and I thought that that<br>company did it<br>the production code and she keeps her brought on<br>which is very disturbing<br>let them titties free<br>let them titties free<br>you don’t like the way they look oh come on<br>just let them free<br>she probably doesn’t like her nipples<br>she looks like she’s probably got some big ones<br>what do you think you gotta guess oh definitely<br>there must be picture wine punch can<br>is there pictures of her nipples out there someday<br>I didn’t watch a whole video<br>I didn’t watch the<br>few seconds skip right<br>I don’t take much time to beat off<br>and I have a very hard time beating off to black eyes<br>fucking white girls<br>I don’t feel like that’s me<br>I don’t feel like you don’t see<br>how much fantasy you can have<br>oh yeah suck my black dick what<br>you know that’s not me<br>I just<br>beat off in front of my new kitten for the first time<br>today yes today<br>and like how much in front of them well<br>I was beating off<br>and the cat jumped right up on my laptop<br>oh well I guess you’re gonna see it eventually<br>so there it is like you feel like<br>like do you<br>it’s like I really hope<br>like my grandparents are<br>like you find out later that you’re like<br>you’re you’re<br>you know ancestors come back as like animals<br>or something that they can watch you like<br>you know what<br>I can’t talk deal with it bitch<br>yeah as long as you can’t talk<br>remember joey’s jug about<br>checking off further cat<br>and about to come and the cat’s doing this I know<br>move got though move got though<br>it’s weird how like<br>cats used to be worshipped back in the days<br>yeah what do you think that’s all<br>and what if there’s something to a cat that we just<br>don’t know and it was lost in transition<br>you know like no one ever wrote it down<br>like oh by the way<br>if you look at the cat’s eyes every day at midnight<br>you can talk to it<br>we know what trips me out about<br>like egyptians worshiping cats<br>it’s like they were so good at making things<br>like how I wonder what they would really<br>like because we don’t really have any idea<br>about their culture like translating their language<br>over to English<br>it’s all so tricky in the hieroglyphs and<br>you know they don’t really know how far back<br>their their history goes because there’s like<br>like john anthony west<br>that guy thinks that their history goes back<br>like 30,000 years<br>and he even has<br>hieroglyphs that prove it<br>but<br>they were so smart when it came to constructing things<br>I wonder what they would like you know socially<br>you know yeah<br>like with just like sitting around talking to him yeah<br>you know<br>it’s really kind of crazy when you think about what<br>those people pulled off<br>and that was like supposedly<br>22,500 years before christ before zero<br>that’s incredible<br>and they were worshipping cats like maybe they were<br>maybe they know what<br>yeah there’s something with cats<br>how fucking smart were they<br>I mean I would like to know how smart they were<br>maybe they were just<br>completely retarded and just really<br>know how to build things<br>and they were just eaaaa<br>and that’s why their culture just sucked<br>but I don’t think so because people like<br>like<br>I think socrates and no<br>herodotus herodotus went over from uh oh<br>no there’s the<br>there’s the yeah<br>that right we just charged in here<br>well this cat is very emotional man<br>sometimes come here spouse<br>she would get mad because we got another cat<br>yeah I’m going there and she started peeing on<br>shit speaking of the other cat just walks in right<br>when you said that<br>oliver come here buddy<br>always cool I like him he’s a cool little dude<br>I like cats you know why I like cats<br>because I’m not starving to death<br>that’s why I don’t understand<br>like when you people are living in Egypt I mean<br>how fucking smart were they<br>they must have had a pretty sophisticated culture<br>because they were really into keeping<br>animals that’s paths and feeding them<br>they’re not gonna get me dogs<br>you’re gonna protect your house they’re gonna do<br>the cats ain’t doing shit right you rub them<br>that’s all you get<br>right you get ipur and I like you rubbing me<br>that’s all it is<br>so they were smart enough to build Pyramids<br>but yet they worshipped cats<br>because<br>there’s something to the cat that we don’t know about<br>spazz<br>is there something the cats you ever see a cat when<br>the light hits their eyes in a certain way<br>and it looks like a hologram or something<br>going on in their eyes<br>that shit’s weird well their eyesight is insane<br>their eyesight is some<br>insane amount better than ours is it<br>oh yeah their eyesight is incredible<br>and it’s dark and their vision is incredible<br>and their hearing is incredible<br>that cat hears everything<br>yeah she’ll hear shit like that her<br>like she’ll be sleeping<br>and you’ll see her all curled up<br>and then I’ll move something in the room<br>you see her little ear just go<br>you know it’s like<br>they’re tuning in to like<br>specific locations where mice are trying to sneak by<br>you know that they got this killer<br>fuck it it’s really weird to see because<br>the bottom line is<br>she only respects me and loves me and everything<br>first of all because I feed her and petter<br>but also because I’m so much bigger than that<br>because if I was smaller than her she would fuck me up<br>cats don’t give a fuck<br>about little things<br>you can’t keep a pet gerbil around your cat<br>they don’t have that agreement<br>you can train a dog to not kill a gerbil<br>you cannot train a cat now you can’t do it<br>now you leave that gerb around<br>that cat is gonna fuck that thing up<br>it’s crazy they cannot avoid it<br>they love it they love killing things man yeah<br>when I was growing up<br>when I was a kid we had a big ass black tomcat<br>and he used to kill squirrels<br>and he used to kill squirrels<br>we lived right across the street from this river<br>and there was like this<br>a whole a lot of wooded areas like<br>minimum acres<br>this was a lot of animals around there<br>and these<br>fucking squirrels would be all over this tree<br>and this cat would just<br>creep through the grass<br>he’s a fucking monster and he paws and hover<br>and I would watch him from the<br>window across the street from our house<br>dude it was like it was like national geographic<br>he fucking chases him<br>and the squirrels trying to leave and<br>pounce on their back<br>and get their back and sink their teeth into the neck<br>and drag this thing in between his legs<br>that was what was really crazy<br>he had to squirrel’s body<br>which was almost as big as him<br>it was<br>pretty fucking big like half the size of his body<br>and he’s dragging it in<br>between his legs<br>and taking the squirrel across the street to our house<br>I was like how nutty is that<br>what if I went out and killed a dog<br>what<br>if I went out and killed a dog with a knife in front<br>of you wouldn’t you like look at me different<br>wouldn’t be like pro what the fuck did you use to<br>but you know he came in I’m like what’s up little buddy<br>I’m like rubbing his head<br>what’s up little buddy well you gotta say you gotta<br>you gotta squirrel huh<br>I didn’t I didn’t feel bad<br>he murdered this poor little animal<br>his girl probably had a little squirrel family<br>little squirrel mother he’s not even hungry<br>I feed his fat ass every day<br>he would come<br>and I would give him a fucking kenneth dog<br>kind of little cat food<br>he would be fine<br>maybe that squirrel was trying to help you too<br>like ricky tikki timbo<br>remember that old<br>story where he’s trying to<br>save the family from the snake<br>you know maybe the squirrel was trying to like zero<br>I think squirrels are cool little animals<br>I discriminate when it comes to rodents like squirrels<br>they make the grade<br>I never feel bad when I see them<br>but if I see a rat that’s close<br>you know a rat is that close<br>like say if you’re sitting with your kid at the park<br>and there’s a tree<br>and the tree is literally right there<br>and the tree’s got a square<br>oh look at the squirrel<br>look at the squirrel he’s right there<br>but if that was a rat<br>you’re like oh get the fucking back<br>the rat’s there<br>it’s a rat yeah get a fucking stick<br>yeah get a rat<br>get out you just start freaking out<br>yelling shade<br>fuck you the fuck out of here right right<br>fucking rat I use<br>I’m scared of rats dude<br>that’s with that big and I’m scared of them in jersey<br>they’ll like come at you yeah you know<br>like you gotta be careful like don’t bite your ass man<br>I gotta came after by a skunk last week<br>skunk like charged me in the dog<br>of course my dog says like kill kill kill<br>won’t listen to me<br>but doesn’t know it’s gonna spray him<br>and then that’s gonna be like 5h of my time<br>of trying to be used<br>vinegar and imagine what they smell like dog<br>dogs have these insane<br>what do you like it or not<br>oh my god of course they don’t like it<br>that would be fun if they did what<br>that would be like<br>an animal that’s trying to commit suicide<br>yeah you know if that was the evolutionary thing like<br>what met the dogs loved it<br>you’d spray your shit the dogs liked it<br>they’d want you to sprite<br>so they’d want to kill you all the time<br>it’s like cat with catnip<br>why does catnip not work on any other animal<br>these guys are weird<br>look at this guy joe what’s your favorite way to smoke<br>like some people get nutty about it<br>just smoke your weed people dude<br>there’s a certain group of people<br>that follow you that are so burnt out<br>that they just like<br>you know they’re like maybe he’s young to the game<br>right well there’s a lot of young healthwise<br>the vaporizer is certainly your best bet<br>bongs are nice<br>I like a bong I like less anything<br>brian doesn’t give a fuck<br>goes right to the collector dick<br>joints joints are good<br>because you don’t have to light it once<br>you know but really<br>if you want to do it the healthiest way<br>of vaporize this way to go<br>and don’t think that eating it is just as healthy<br>people think that eating pot is just as healthy<br>it is I mean it’s not gonna kill you<br>but it will freak you out<br>and one of the reasons why it freaks your ass<br>because it produces this thing<br>called 11 hydroxy<br>it’s a metabolite that your liver produces when<br>you eat marijuana<br>and apparently it’s not psychoactive<br>when you smoke it<br>like it’s so you don’t give the same effect<br>but when you eat marijuana it becomes like four<br>times more psychoactive<br>then if you smoke it<br>so if you have like a lot<br>of weed and you make brownies with them<br>that’s the problem with these things<br>you eat a brownie and you’re like what the fuck<br>oh you can’t believe<br>how much weed is in it<br>you have to sit down<br>it’s because as it’s going through your system<br>it’s creating this 11 hydroxy metabolite<br>which I like<br>and one of the reasons why I like it is because it<br>makes me very self critical<br>it makes me examine all<br>sorts of things about myself like there’s anything<br>about myself that I don’t like<br>if I’m being lazy if I’m being a douchebag if I’m<br>being short with people<br>if I’m not you know<br>if I’m not focused on what I really<br>should be focused on in my life<br>anything that might be bugging me my subconscious mind<br>this 11 hydroxy makes you think about it like in depth<br>and it can really freak people out<br>if you’ve got<br>some shit that you’re pushing in the back of your head<br>you know it’s like what people call<br>I was paranoid I was paranoid I<br>think what paranoid is is people<br>that when you get high in marijuana<br>I think what paranoid is people<br>who just are<br>they’re getting too much information for them to manage<br>and they haven’t done such a good job of<br>managing their consciousness in the first place<br>and so when this stuff is hitting them<br>what’s happening is<br>they’re just it’s overload and they can’t control it<br>and they freak out and they say I can’t smoke weed<br>it gets me paranoid<br>but I think it’s more indicative of this<br>you don’t really know how you feel about yourself<br>you don’t really know how you feel about life<br>you’re looking at life through<br>areas because you’re trying to not see everything<br>because you’re trying to focus on<br>one particular thing with your life<br>or trying to get your shit together<br>and you don’t realize how many things about your life<br>really are<br>freaking you out and bothering you<br>until you smoke pot and pot just<br>makes you examine them<br>you know we<br>as people we like to avoid shit that bugs us<br>it’s all like when people<br>like overeat to get over some childhood molestation<br>they don’t even fucking realize what they’re doing<br>they’re just distracting themselves with something else<br>you know<br>I think I think we do shit like that all the time<br>don’t you think mm hmm<br>I kind of lost you in the air halfway<br>we’re talking about it<br>listen be careful with your weed that’s all<br>I’m saying<br>being paranoid is a good thing it’s for real it is<br>I mean the experience of being paranoid<br>when you smoke weed<br>it’s to get you to look at yourself<br>it’s to get you to look at life<br>it’s you’re not<br>you’re not looking at it all as clearly as you could<br>and those jolts of perception<br>you misinterpret as paranoia<br>what you’re doing is just dealing with the information<br>that’s already been there<br>just the fact that you this fleshy<br>temporary soft mushy creature<br>that is literally connected<br>with nothing above your head except<br>gases and air and then fucking space<br>and above that there’s<br>asteroids and<br>planets and fucking giant nuclear explosions and suns<br>and it’s all right there<br>and you’re just this thing<br>that doesn’t exactly know what it’s doing<br>is kind of like going along with the<br>flow of everybody else and<br>sitting in traffic like everybody else<br>hoping that someone<br>of us is like guiding this thing<br>but they’re not<br>no one’s guiding shit<br>and that is if you’re not thinking about that<br>if you don’t<br>you haven’t addressed that as a human being<br>and you start eating fucking pot brownies<br>that shit will club you over the head<br>you’ll freak out you’ll be scared<br>you’ll curl into a fetal position you know<br>what what life really is is frightening to people<br>and marijuana will expose the fuck out of that<br>expose what it really is you know this is not a goddamn<br>movie that’s the problem<br>we are living life<br>like it is a movie because we’re fucking<br>we really are programmed by culture<br>I think I mean I love movies don’t get me wrong<br>I love cds I love songs I love<br>I love all forms of expression<br>all entertaining forms of expression except dance<br>dance like<br>musicals that doesn’t mean shit to me<br>I see choreographed dancing<br>like oh you’re moving together<br>yeah you don’t like how hard you do<br>you don’t like like<br>musical movies at all or<br>south parks south park musical<br>yeah that was a beautiful<br>beautiful musical<br>yeah what’s beautiful<br>I need to make a new south park<br>maybe what the fuck it’s<br>except all the kidnanians must have been very past<br>right they’re always pissed right now ginger’s are piss<br>have you seen that ginger video<br>no is that when people are beaten up redheaded<br>well no this kid who’s a redhead fucked up man<br>this kid who’s a redheaded has this<br>where where speed come from<br>where’s the part<br>that’s crazy that’s that<br>because there’s an episode where<br>like gingers were like rush<br>what’s happening with<br>some kid like right<br>they’re mimicking south parks like head of ginger day<br>and kids were hitting them all day right right<br>they’re mimicking south park<br>well I mean that’s nothing new<br>when you’re in high school<br>you’re looking for excuse to be the fuck other right<br>right<br>so the video is this redheaded guy that gives like<br>a speech for 4min<br>and it’s kind of like leave brittany alone style<br>and it’s just<br>it’s you don’t want<br>he brings up god and religion through it and stuff<br>and it’s just you sit there like terrified of this guy<br>not bad for him I was just terrified of him<br>you gotta watch it and he will break or something<br>but he’s fucking up the whole cause yeah<br>for all the redheads the redheads that want love<br>yeah crazy bitch<br>that’s the problem is by the time you know<br>you’re out there looking for love<br>you’re probably so goddamn damaged<br>yes most of us are fucking damaged right<br>I mean if you had to<br>if you had to guess like what amount of people<br>are still working out issues from a childhood<br>it’s 100 it’s 100 yeah it’s not even really damaged<br>it’s just that’s what happens you know<br>well it’s also you have to reprogram<br>like the way you look at the world<br>you know<br>you look at the world a certain way because you think<br>you know that’s how you were taught by your parents<br>and you know when you’re like in your<br>teen years you start having to restructure things<br>your teen years you start looking at things like<br>they don’t even know what the fuck they’re talking<br>about they’re talking crazy shit and you realize<br>god damn it my parents are just some fucking people<br>just like all the other idiots that I meet all<br>day they just fucked<br>they’re no different than my idiot friends<br>they’re no different than my idiot teachers<br>they just fucked<br>they fucked and they made me and suck shit<br>and so<br>when those teenage years<br>when you’re trying to like reformulate the view<br>that’s when it starts<br>and it continues through your whole life<br>you know<br>do you think that you would be the same dude though<br>if you had like a<br>oh I don’t want to wash that man<br>no description sex holes I don’t want to watch that<br>do you think you would be the same dude if you had<br>a perfect childhood<br>no I think it’s just like that<br>your whole<br>theory about like you are how you lived<br>you know everyone starts off<br>the same person pretty much<br>and just every single little thing that builds to it<br>I kind of believe that you know<br>it’s like if you roll down the hill you’re gonna<br>in a mud you’re gonna look different than the person<br>next to you<br>yeah that’s why people really have to have compassion<br>because you know<br>if we really are all the same thing<br>this is my theory if you haven’t heard it before<br>and I had this when I was ate some pot<br>and I was on a boat in Hawaii<br>and I was<br>on this boat and we<br>were fishing and there was<br>dolphins that were next to the<br>dolphins were playing with us they would get by the<br>boat and they would jump up in the air and we would go<br>whoa<br>and every time they jump up in the air we go what’s up<br>what’s up what’s up dolphin<br>and when we would do that they would get excited<br>and so they were like showing off<br>they were like communicating with us<br>I was like god damn they’re so conscious<br>and I started thinking about it<br>like they’re responding to us<br>I’m like I wonder what<br>life must be like<br>what consciousness must be like for the dolphin<br>and I wonder if it’s similar to humans<br>and I wonder if it’s the same<br>I was thinking<br>I wonder if they have the exact same consciousness<br>it’s just filtered through an entirely different<br>environment a totally different<br>skin you know you’re in<br>a fish’s body<br>and a totally different way of communicating<br>a totally different language<br>that’s almost decipherable<br>but what if it’s exactly the same thing<br>the inside the consciousness<br>and then I thought about I’m like oh my god<br>like what if that’s the case with people<br>what if we are all exactly the same thing<br>we just<br>are transmitted through different biological filters<br>different<br>life experiences different childhoods different<br>everything different<br>genetic roles of the dice<br>I mean people are born with different<br>ailments and diseases and<br>people are born crippled<br>you know what what<br>the reason why I’m supposed to have compassion is that<br>easily could have been you<br>it’s just a like a<br>filter that the consciousness is going through<br>but the consciousness is one thing<br>it’s all the same<br>you are just like me is just like<br>and your uniqueness has to do<br>with your biology<br>and your interpretations of your experiences<br>as you’re growing up<br>you know you’re unique personality<br>you’re a unique personality that everybody talks about<br>when you’re a child<br>could easily be attributed to<br>what kind of machine you’re running<br>you know let me take something<br>everybody’s biology is different<br>you know that if you watch porn right<br>there’s people that were<br>blessed with gigantic dicks<br>and there’s poor dudes with little tiny dicks<br>and there’s girls with incredible bodies<br>and there’s other girls that like<br>whatever no matter what they do<br>they can’t lose that last 20 pounds like that’s just<br>fact that is what it is you’re born with<br>there’s variables like there’s variables with oranges<br>you’ll see one orange is big<br>and another one that’s not so big<br>they’re not all the same<br>and these various chemicals<br>and then on top of these various chemicals<br>that are all in balance all these different hormones<br>on top of that<br>then it’s like how does this particular model interact<br>with its environment<br>your own unique experiences<br>I mean how many times have you seen something<br>your friends didn’t<br>and it fucked you up for the rest of the day<br>you know like you see someone get hit by a car<br>or you see something<br>and then you have the same friends you go to the same<br>and all of a sudden<br>you don’t want to hang out with them anymore<br>you think the things are frivolous<br>you think they’re being retarded<br>you know you hear about a girl getting<br>raped and you’re the one who freaks out<br>you see one thing<br>and it will set you off in a certain direction<br>and it’s like<br>so who the fuck knows what your personality is<br>you know who the fuck knows how much of it is your body<br>how much of it is<br>your experience<br>is how much of it is what you learn from your parents<br>and how much it theirs is the same shit<br>how much of your personality is really just<br>you reacting and saying what you have to say<br>and doing what you have to do to get<br>by in your environment<br>but at the core of everybody<br>from fucking serial killers<br>to the most compassionate people on earth<br>it’s very likely that the consciousness is the same<br>male female that’s all biological<br>it’s very logical that the thinking it’s very possible<br>that the root of it all<br>when you think about yourself as you<br>that it’s all the same<br>that’s nuts<br>that’s nuts<br>somehow cats involved with it<br>those cats they’re honestly shit<br>they’re on some shit<br>yeah that’s really interesting because<br>then when there’s like personality<br>tests on websites like those<br>dating websites we are talking about<br>so like there’s you take personality<br>tests so you’re all trying to take a test<br>that’s based on what<br>you know the person<br>you know like you know how do they know<br>it’s kind of a personality test was stupid as fuck<br>that’s just like<br>the same people<br>that have glitter tags on their mice based basics<br>you know what are you taking<br>you don’t know what your fucking personality is like<br>once you go sit down<br>in the grass by yourself and think about shit<br>you know<br>take a guide to a meditation class at certain point<br>time is a human being you<br>become responsible for your own biology<br>you know and that’s what we don’t teach people<br>we need to teach kids in school<br>there needs to be<br>you know you have math and you have English<br>and these are all very important subjects<br>but what we also need is how to manage your mind<br>how to think how to think correctly<br>how to when something comes up in your life<br>how to deal with it and turn it<br>into something to your advantage<br>how not to go<br>into a negative spiral<br>and have your whole fucking life fall apart<br>because of one thing in that<br>that’s these are it’s very important<br>that people learn how to think how to control your mind<br>you know and how many people actually do that<br>it’s not that many right<br>I mean it’s not that many<br>people really know how to think<br>you know how to think<br>positively how to affect<br>the people around you as possibly as you can<br>how to move your life into the way<br>you move your life into a healthy place<br>very hard to do<br>it’s because we’re all starting from scratch<br>you know we’re all starting from scratch<br>we’re all trying to read books<br>we never taught that shit in school<br>they mean if they really want to teach you<br>how to be a good employee<br>how to you know make a good living<br>that’s you being a better person<br>being better at being a person<br>being better at managing your life is very important<br>they should be teaching kids how to think correctly<br>like early in school and they should have discipline<br>and I don’t mean discipline little by like you know<br>you know do whatever what it tells you to do<br>that’s not discipline<br>what discipline is is<br>you have to do a certain amount<br>you have to do something like do anything<br>anything that’s really hard<br>like whether it’s swimming or archery<br>or you know playing chess or<br>you know doing gigitsu<br>for kids having<br>something that’s difficult to do is very important<br>they need to be pushed<br>you know it’s very very important<br>you could develop<br>so much more of who you are<br>if you’ve already pushed your boundaries<br>if you’ve been lazy your whole life<br>it’s so hard to get out of not being lazy anymore<br>and this is all shit that they should be teaching<br>in school man<br>they should totally be teaching that shit in school<br>you know it’s not just history<br>you know when I was a kid they fucking taught us<br>Columbus discovered america<br>you know that was still being taught<br>and now we know for a fact he didn’t<br>I think it still is isn’t it<br>I don’t think so dude really<br>I mean he’s still<br>we celebrated Columbus day<br>but I think now they say he landed in the west indies<br>let’s reach for questions later gentlemen<br>are we serious about that dolphin stuff yeah man<br>dolphins rape other dolphins oh I know they do<br>they do<br>they rape other dolphins they eat dolphin babies<br>it’s that you know<br>infantrous side and dolphins<br>I think that’s what it’s called is<br>what they do is the female dolphins try to fuck as many<br>male dolphins as they can<br>because if<br>they run across a male<br>dolphin that they haven’t fucked<br>and they have babies<br>the male might kill the babies to get<br>the female to breed<br>because the females won’t breed<br>while they’re taking care of their young<br>so they have to fuck as many male dolphins as they can<br>so that when they do come across a male dolphin<br>and he sees them with the baby<br>if she fuck them<br>he won’t kill the babies<br>because he doesn’t know if they’re his<br>it’s crazy humans you know rape and kill babies too<br>yeah yeah I mean we don’t do it<br>in such large numbers as dolphins though<br>I mean dolphins do<br>it kind of like as a matter of<br>you know yeah but they’re more bored they’re<br>in the water all day like what the fuck we don’t have<br>I think it’s that they’re bored<br>I think it’s that see<br>they can’t affect their environment<br>we see evolution and dolphins and it’s in a very<br>strange scale<br>it’s very much different than ours<br>it’s like they’re super intelligent and cognitive<br>you know<br>they have these amazing abilities to communicate<br>but yet they can’t move anything with their hands<br>they don’t create anything so they’re out in the wild<br>so their world is just way harsher<br>they’re basically dolphins are like<br>the fucking blue people in avatar<br>you know<br>the blue people in avatar are like super intelligent<br>but these motherfuckers live in the jungle<br>you got to be hard<br>you know you ain’t like some<br>soft dude behind a computer keyboard<br>you know you gotta be like that crazy bit<br>shooting arrows at those crazy<br>black dog things<br>you know and that’s what dolphins are like<br>man they’re in the fucking woods<br>they’re in the ocean but that’s<br>there’s sharks out there man<br>killer whales eat dolphins all the time<br>their cousins match<br>if your cousin ate you<br>killer whales will fuck up some dolphins<br>they fuck up sharks too<br>killer whales at the pimps of the ocean<br>they’re just running shit<br>you know they don’t take shit from nobody<br>you know the only people they do is people<br>that’s the only thing that they take shift<br>because people this is a<br>story that I read on the internet and this<br>I would like to add<br>ask you Twitter people<br>and people on watching on u stream<br>I wonder if<br>if it’s possible that this is a true story<br>what I heard was that<br>the orcas or killer whales<br>used to attack people<br>and been attacking people for a long time<br>but then after world war ii they stopped<br>and<br>one of the reasons why it’s that as american soldiers<br>were apparently<br>targeting killer whales in the ocean for practice<br>you know that’s how they would work on their<br>you know shooting out of their planes<br>and it would drop bombs on them and shit<br>the whales just completely stopped eating people<br>I mean that<br>seems like something somebody made up right doesn’t it<br>but what if it wasn’t<br>that would be pretty fucking crazy<br>because I know cultures do have<br>images like old<br>eskimo images<br>just like a killer whale attacking people<br>like really ancient stuff<br>I wonder<br>they’d be interesting if they knew what was up<br>you know if like oh they go<br>these motherfuckers can fly<br>now and drop shits from those<br>okay we’re good<br>we want to eat anymore we’re done this bet we tap<br>imagine I mean if they eat everything else<br>why would they eat people<br>they save people all the time<br>like that’s really nutty<br>when you’re talking about an animal<br>that’s that intelligent<br>like murders dolphins<br>when people fall in the ocean<br>killer whales have been known and many times to<br>nudge people towards boats and help them<br>yeah maybe that’s crazy<br>same as dolphins<br>then none of them fuck with people<br>because we have the ability to change our environment<br>they’re just as ruthless<br>just as smart<br>but they’re fucked with their bodies<br>they’re little fucking flippers and shit<br>they’ll fuck you up if you’re in their world<br>but that’s what you need to get by in their world<br>our world requires much more finer moves<br>you know and our ability to manipulate shit<br>like have things gone just<br>a little bit different in evolution<br>if you believe in evolution<br>you know the<br>dolphins and easel they could easily be brown shit<br>the killer rails and dolphins<br>imagine if there was something like that with us<br>if those are all the same intelligence<br>imagine there was something like that with us<br>like some giant trolls that were just as smart as us<br>and would come in and kill people<br>to show up your village and start eating us<br>and just jacking us<br>well that is happening that’s us and monkeys day wolf<br>well that’s us and monkeys<br>if you look at like african countries<br>bush meat you see they<br>sell chimpanzee hands as ashtrays and shit<br>they just go<br>into the forest and fuck those things up and eat them<br>yeah you know<br>that’s pretty crazy we think about it<br>what if there’s something like that with us<br>whoo that could happen man don’t think it can happen<br>well wouldn’t like<br>yeah could you fucking imagine I mean there is<br>there are predators right humans<br>if you’re around them yeah like tigers right stuff<br>yeah but<br>you know for the most part they’re not intelligent<br>these fucking things are intelligent<br>killer whales are just as smart as dolphins<br>they’re genius<br>yeah they’re like a smartest human supposedly<br>well if that’s the case man<br>could you imagine of something as smart as people<br>but giant and likes to eat us robots<br>no that’s what it’s gonna be<br>we’re gonna build or we’re gonna build our enemy<br>our predator we’re gonna build our predator<br>some new months who’s gonna come from the sky<br>yeah we would never be able to get to this point<br>the reason why we’ve got to this point<br>culture with<br>technology with our inventions and all the shit<br>the reason why it’s because no one’s been eating us<br>we’ve had all this downtime<br>with all this downtime to come up with things<br>because otherwise we would have never<br>gotten to this point<br>you never be comfortable enough to sit around<br>crunching algorithms<br>trying to figure out how to make a pentium processor<br>you would never get to that point<br>you would be constantly running from the giant troll<br>people that want to eat your asshole<br>you know they were<br>just kill people and the way<br>chimps eat monkeys<br>you ever watch the way chimps eat monkeys<br>yeah they like tamara party<br>they eat them while they’re alive<br>yeah they don’t kill them<br>that’s a weird thing about predators<br>seem to kill people<br>and then eat them like big cats<br>you know like<br>you know animals that like kill things for a living<br>you know like big cats big cats<br>they only eat grass so they can throw up<br>that’s all they do<br>and these these animals<br>when they catch something<br>it’s very important that they kill it<br>so they just grab them by the neck and<br>jack them immediately<br>but like chimps don’t do that<br>chimps eat berries<br>they eat all kinds of shit they’re omnivores<br>they can eat meat or<br>vegetables and fruits<br>so when they<br>kill monkeys which is like their favorite shit to do<br>love monkeys they love to eat them<br>and they have all these elaborate traps<br>where they there’s you can see them online<br>we’ll find you the YouTube clip<br>I’ll find it right now<br>because it’s pretty fucking trippy<br>it’s YouTube I’m just gonna YouTube chimpsee monkeys<br>and my point is<br>they eat them alive<br>man they eat them alive<br>they rip them apart they don’t kill them first<br>that same thing with bears<br>bears you ever see like a bear when it<br>that’s the thing about that timothy treadwell<br>dude from grizzly man<br>the fucking video or the video is there’s a<br>cap on the video when the bear adam<br>but the audio is there and the audio was 7min long<br>7min long why is that not leaked yet<br>seven because<br>the woman who was his girlfriend<br>didn’t want it to leak<br>if you don’t if you haven’t seen grizzly man<br>you must you must secrecy man<br>it’s one of the most genius fucking movies<br>ever and it’s like a subtle comedy<br>I mean it’s so hard to describe this guy was so insane<br>and he was living with bears<br>and the way it’s edited together<br>and warner herzog is typically not known for making<br>funny movies right<br>he’s like a serious directive right<br>I don’t think he meant to make this funny now<br>but this guy’s so ridiculous<br>he’s look at bear<br>hey come here come here<br>he’s gayer than ricky martin in a room full of dicks<br>he’s he’s this guy so gay<br>and he’s like<br>out there in the woods with a camera going<br>if I was gay I could just meet a girl and we could just<br>or could he meet a guy<br>in a restroom<br>we could just hook up but I’m not gay<br>so what do I do yeah kept bringing it up<br>it would do it in specifics<br>I gotta just go to a restop right<br>it was a great movie I need a reward<br>fantastic movie grizzly men you have to see it<br>but this guy was like really<br>into saving the grizzly bear<br>so he’s up there in Alaska<br>and he’s like<br>you know the fucking park ranges<br>nannies by the fuckers<br>I’m out here saving him every day<br>and the bears are looking like who is this crazy bitch<br>like they wouldn’t do anything<br>it was letting people know that bears were there<br>and but they knew bears were there<br>like he wasn’t saving them<br>they’re in a national park<br>you know right<br>occasionally there’s poaching but<br>that’s gonna happen everywhere<br>they’re not gonna not poach cause you’re they’re stupid<br>you know okay here<br>jim’s killing and eating a monkey<br>I’m gonna take this<br>yeah this is the one it’s ruthless<br>woo I’ll take this link<br>and I’ll throw it up on Twitter right now<br>for my peep pose<br>when I’m really high I can’t type that good<br>if I think about it<br>been to the zoo the Los angeles zoo<br>yeah I don’t like to go to the zoo after<br>the last time I when I wrote that piece<br>about the zoo the animal prison on in the blog<br>but I realized because I was super baked<br>and when I you know<br>like we were talked about earlier when you super baked<br>you’re like much more sensitive<br>and I was watching these animals<br>and like this is a horrendous life<br>just because they can move doesn’t mean they’re alive<br>they don’t allow the predators to kill and eat<br>that’s like<br>they take you away and you can’t talk to people ever<br>again you know you<br>get locked up in a room by yourself<br>and something else other than you has to stare at you<br>and then you don’t even<br>get to you know<br>the one pleasure that animals that are predators get<br>I mean the reason why they go after<br>the kill it must be orgasmic<br>I mean it’s what they need to stay alive<br>and they’re doing it with their mouth<br>and they’re feeling the life leave the animal<br>and I mean<br>it’s imperative<br>for them to be really awesome at killing things<br>in order for them to survive<br>what it must that feel like to them must be incredible<br>I mean it feels good for us to fuck<br>and there’s so many of us<br>it’s like it’s not even important if you fuck<br>you know I’m saying<br>but it’s your body<br>is so<br>programmed by<br>all the years of evolution to think that it’s very<br>very important to make new human being<br>so you get this fantastic reward when you fuck<br>it just feels so good<br>and what it really<br>is is just nature trying to trick you<br>nature making<br>sure that you’re rewarded for doing what you have<br>to do to stay alive and to continue the race<br>well with a jaguar every day you have to kill some shit<br>the fucking the physical<br>rush the sensation of chasing something down<br>as it’s running through the forest<br>you’re not sure if you’re gonna get it<br>and sometimes they<br>get away and bam<br>you got that motherfucker right by the neck<br>and you feel it’s hard beating<br>its legs are kicking<br>and you just put that little antelope down<br>that must be fantastic<br>must be fantastic and you don’t even give him that<br>you just put him in this cage and you<br>slide cold meat in a tray<br>and he eats it and just like what the fuck<br>what the fuck did I do to deserve this yeah<br>I mean if you’re gonna keep them around<br>I could see the argument much more<br>to kill all the predators<br>than I could to keep any of them around and cage<br>yeah you know because I can see like you say and listen<br>we’re gonna get some video<br>of all these animals that can eat us<br>we get some nice video<br>documented a bunch of different<br>formats mpeg mov put on iphones<br>and then we’re gonna kill them<br>we’re gonna kill all of them anything that kills us<br>but why don’t<br>what if they were to do it like they had a huge open<br>crazy space and they made it kind of like<br>fun and everything that they would want<br>but then they would like throw on like arc<br>here’s a cow into the situation<br>well<br>yeah no<br>I don’t know I don’t think you want them<br>the problem is people don’t want to see that shit<br>I mean at night or support me<br>how about the day<br>I mean if you’re gonna do it steve<br>if you really want to teach children<br>why is it okay<br>it’s kind of funny<br>because why is it okay<br>to watch something<br>like that on the national geographics show right<br>you know on discovery channel<br>they show you all the time<br>have you ever seen relentless enemies<br>maybe I’m pretty sure it’s called relentless enemies<br>it’s a fucking amazing documentary about<br>these lions in africa that are exercised<br>they look like cartoon lines<br>they’re a lot like like giant mike tyson lines<br>they’re so ridiculous and the females are bigger<br>the normal african male lines or as big if not bigger<br>than normal african male lines which is unprecedented<br>I mean that never exists<br>these fucking lions are gigantic<br>and the reason why they’re gigantic is cause they<br>the river where they live<br>change course about 100 years ago<br>and all may not even be 100<br>it might be<br>more reason than that I have to look it up but they<br>got stuck on this one island with water buffalo<br>only water buffalo<br>so in order to survive they had only<br>killed a toughest thing to kill<br>so these giant fucking water<br>buffaloes are dangerous as fuck<br>they’re super powerful<br>they got these giant horns and they’ll come at you<br>and stomp your ass<br>and they get broken legs and they can’t hunt again<br>and then they’re fucking starved to death<br>so it’s a fucking dangerous proposition<br>well these ants<br>these tigers got gigantic<br>because of it<br>they got fucking huge<br>and it’s really fascinating man<br>really fascinating to watch them<br>you know try to<br>figure out how they’re gonna take out these water<br>buffalo and they’re just<br>so much bigger than regular lions<br>it’s like it’s crazy to watch man<br>really really intense documentary<br>you’re a huge documentary<br>like how many documentary is a day do you watch<br>two three<br>I watch a lot of them

2 out of 3 are saying these<br>three reviews that are on the front page<br>anyway the documentary itself<br>if these poor guys could give their dvd to work<br>it’s fucking incredible<br>I mean it just shows you how quickly life can adapt<br>you know there’s these<br>you know the amazon rainforest has only existed<br>not like the amazon<br>rather the Congo<br>has only<br>existed in that form for like a few thousand years and<br>thousands of years before that it was like grasslands<br>so there’s animals that are trapped inside the Congo<br>that are animals that live on the grass planes<br>like rhinos are trapped in there and deer and antelope<br>and there’s one little antelope that has<br>developed the ability to swim underwater<br>because the Congo is filled with water<br>develop the ability swim underwater up to 100 yards<br>and it eats fish<br>and it’s a fucking antelope and it’s got<br>these little short ass legs because<br>evolution dictated that this animal change<br>I mean and that happened over 2000 years<br>there’s a fish<br>in the amazon that comes out of the fucking water<br>and walks yes it’s awesome<br>it’s crazy and it finds another water hole<br>and then there’s this fucking bird that eats it<br>that looks like a goddamn dinosaur<br>it’s a six foot tall<br>evil giant bird with this crazy big ass fucking beak<br>like this big<br>killing machine<br>attached to its face<br>and it’s got these<br>dead eyes like these dead crazy dinosaur eagle eyes<br>and it jacks this fucking old dinosaur walking fish<br>and you like whoa that’s a nutty goddamn place<br>that’s the same planet we live on yeah<br>that’s the same planet we live on<br>here’s to that old video of the eagle<br>like killing all those goats throwing<br>them all into cliffs<br>it’s awesome this eagle just is like<br>on top of a cliff and there’s all these goats<br>and it’s just like<br>grabbing them and throwing them off the cliffs<br>they would die<br>and eat them at the body<br>and it could barely carry them<br>but it’s dragging them like it’s like<br>doing it on purpose<br>it could have killed them if it was just on flat land<br>it knows it’s gonna kill them by<br>dragging them off the rock<br>I mean that’s incredible<br>birds are smart too man like that<br>the whatever those blackbirds are<br>raven roses are smart yeah where<br>they they have<br>they use tools<br>yeah have you seen that yeah<br>yeah I’ve seen them do all kinds of creepy shit<br>I had a stake and I was trying to<br>thought out and I put it on<br>it was in the rap you know from the supermarket<br>and I put it on<br>stone outside my house for<br>a minute maybe a minute<br>I came out and these crows were fucking it up<br>they watched me<br>they watched me put it out and then they swooped in<br>look at anyway I think that is meat<br>this dumb motherfucker left some meat out<br>like there’s no way he’s that stupid<br>he left some meat out<br>I’m telling you it’s meat let’s eat it<br>and they landed on just her<br>fuck it up and I came out there was two of them just<br>fucking up the stake<br>wow they’re so clever that’s crazy<br>a rat wouldn’t have seen it now<br>a flying rat even a flying rat like a pigeon<br>imagine we had flying rats around here<br>how horrible that would be we did with pigeons<br>pigeons are like flying rats<br>unless you’re raising yourself in the cute<br>I’ve been putting bird feed out lately on my backyard<br>and the bird feed I put out<br>attracts these little canaries<br>and now I have just little canaries everywhere<br>I’ve never in Ohio they don’t have canaries or these<br>fellas very specific<br>have either of you guys tried jwho<br>I heard about this the other day what is it what is it<br>there’s a topic on your form about it<br>I can’t remember<br>what is this oh my god<br>I hear it is how crazy you internet kids are<br>you’re coming out with new ways to get high<br>it’s an analogies chemical<br>from the amino alkaline node<br>how do you say that<br>and<br>amino alkylindo family<br>which acts as a cannabonoid blah blah blah blah<br>well it must be something that gets you fucked up<br>considers a lot of those things too<br>I don’t want to mess with many different new things<br>you know<br>this sounds crazy coming from someone who’s done<br>as many psychodoxes I have<br>but I think the shit<br>that you should do is the shit that people<br>have been doing for thousands of years<br>you know you can’t go wrong with<br>san pedro cactus<br>you can’t go wrong with cannabis mushrooms<br>you can’t go wrong with those things<br>iosco you can’t go wrong I mean you can’t go wrong<br>you lose your fucking marvels<br>don’t listen to me<br>what I’m saying is<br>new stuff like you know hey man try this new shit<br>scientists fucking nasa labs man<br>it just came up with it<br>um<br>no no<br>don’t do anything<br>that people haven’t been doing a long time<br>yeah I know<br>don’t fuck with some new shit that they just invented<br>right weed tests and you smoke it<br>makes you want to fuck animals you know<br>I don’t know follow<br>the old indians they were their beta testers<br>yes you know zach they were down with paeli<br>that was their shit the san pedro cactus the masculine<br>I’ve never done that<br>have you ever done that<br>see that was just crazy that these things are illegal<br>I mean bill hicks had a great line about that<br>like isn’t there something<br>fucked up about making nature against the law<br>you know it was totally totally true<br>I mean<br>how could you tell someone that they can’t have a life<br>form that exists naturally on this planet<br>whether it’s cannabis or mushrooms or<br>you know anything<br>anything that grows naturally you can buy<br>it’s only anything that’s affects your consciousness<br>you can buy stuff that’s poisonous like you can legally<br>have a bunch of different plants that can kill you<br>a bunch of different plants<br>you know it’s like you<br>just having marijuana in your backyard is not<br>proof that you’re eating marijuana or using it<br>and if you have all these<br>poisonous plants in your backyard<br>nobody would even have a bad an eye<br>and that’s the same thing it’s not<br>I mean<br>it’s a personally use issue you know<br>it’s really so weird that people allow<br>in this day and age<br>with all the information that we have<br>allow plants to be illegal<br>I mean it’s fucking pretty incredible plants<br>it’s pretty incredible<br>it’s fucking really bizarre that we<br>enforce it so strictly<br>it’s such a strong ethic in our<br>culture that if we catch you using certain plants<br>that have nothing to do with me<br>they not affect me at all<br>but if I catch you with these plants<br>I’m allowed by our laws to lock you in a cage<br>how crazy is that<br>if you have a giant ass bag of mushrooms and you are<br>driving on your way to the woods<br>and a cop pulls you over<br>and it says what are you doing like<br>well<br>I’m about to have a spiritual experience with the lord<br>the cop ago what the fuck you talking about<br>well I have these<br>mushrooms that I’m gonna<br>go out to get the fuck out of the car<br>get out of the car<br>he’ll handcuff you<br>you fucking idiot you’re telling me about this<br>I’m just letting you know man I’m just a nature<br>it’s natural<br>it grows on the earth that it’s shut the fuck up<br>shut up<br>I don’t wanna hear it I wanna hear you hippy bullshit<br>right get in the fucking car<br>I just hit the mother low with this stupid fuck<br>this guy told me he had mushrooms on him how high is he<br>ho ho ho ho<br>and you you wanna eat yeah let’s go to sally’s<br>and then they meet up and<br>they feel good for locking this kind of cage<br>for having plants on them<br>yeah that’s bizarre<br>2010 that’s strange<br>I mean it’s very hard to believe that’s the case<br>anyways really strange<br>about 2010 is that we’re going towards 2020<br>that’s just<br>that’s craziness<br>just the sound of it<br>this guy says it’s because of money though<br>yeah it’s definitely because of money<br>but it’s just it’s amazing<br>you know here’s the best example of how it’s for sure<br>politicians or whores<br>best example nobody talks about cigarettes<br>if cigarettes was if al qaeda<br>was killing 400,000 people in america every year<br>holy shit with the war against al qaeda heat up<br>it would be gigantic<br>as it is<br>they’re killing people<br>most of them that they’ve killed you know<br>unless you listen to alex jones<br>there’s a government<br>with most of them<br>in other countries<br>I mean in this country alone<br>al qaeda is not where jack and people<br>but cigarettes are cigarettes<br>he’ll 400 fucking thousand people here<br>I mean compare something you use for<br>personal use to al qaeda is ridiculous<br>absolutely but what my point is like<br>it’s very dangerous<br>marijuana doesn’t do that<br>even alcohol doesn’t kill that<br>many people think about how fucked up alcohol gets you<br>and alcohol poisoning or alcohol deaths<br>it’s not nearly as high as cigarettes<br>cigarettes is a motherfucker and it’s so hard to kick<br>right you went back on him right yeah<br>brian I quit a couple times that was a year<br>he’s done it a couple times<br>and one little thing will set<br>that trigger off in the back of his head<br>it’s mostly stress stuff<br>it’s horrible but<br>meanwhile it’s totally legal<br>and did we talk about the oxycontin express last week<br>we did right god we talk about cigarettes too<br>we talk those cigarettes<br>these are poor edition<br>if you<br>haven’t seen the awesome cut express get on that shit<br>find it online<br>I think it’s on YouTube<br>the whole thing is and<br>it’s one of those directors versions<br>so the whole thing is on YouTube<br>so this weekend you’re at the ice house<br>yeah oh yeah yeah<br>we’re doing comedy this weekend<br>which is making it happen<br>he’s gonna be joey yes yeah<br>at the ice house in pasadena<br>this Friday we’re doing two shows there<br>in Saturday we’re doing two shows<br>nice this guy says dmt is not easy to extract<br>well you ain’t no super secret scientist are you oh<br>doo doo doo<br>every smoke banana peel see these motherfuckers<br>yeah I smoked a lot of shit when I was young<br>it was stupid I was trying to get high<br>I smoked like bamboo leaves it’s horrible<br>very harsh on the lungs too<br>mmm<br>birds can be scary they ask on acid oh yeah<br>good point amazing kush<br>yeah birds can be some birds are scary<br>period man you ever look at an eagle’s eye<br>like you ever seen a dude that has like a pet eagle<br>look on those talk shows<br>and they get close up on an eagle’s eye<br>this girl I know just got an owl as a peg oh and<br>have you seen those are murderers<br>they just murderers<br>I know it just sits in their bathroom on the shower<br>thing yo that ain’t cool<br>that’s a predator<br>it’s crazy that’s a real like owls look all<br>fluffy and cool and everything<br>because everybody thinks about them<br>from those goddamn tootsie roll commercial<br>tutsi pops that’s not no that’s a fucking predator<br>yeah that’s right<br>you even laugh to have that<br>what is it about<br>people where we take these evil predators<br>and we change what they are right like polar bears<br>we got them selling<br>you know<br>ice cream coca cola polar bears are fucking monsters<br>polar bears cover their nose<br>when they’re sneaking up on eskimo villages<br>so that they can’t see the black<br>that’s awesome<br>do<br>they learn how to do that hunting seals<br>they take their nose and they<br>hang over the edge of a glacier a floating<br>you know like ice raft<br>and they hang over the edge<br>so that these seals don’t see them<br>they see white everything’s white<br>if they see that black nose<br>they figured out that seals can see the black nose<br>that’s how fucking evil they are<br>and we got them selling ice cream and coca cola<br>tony the tiger that’s great<br>how about chimps man bj in the bear<br>just do tooling around with a little pet monkey<br>how come bj in the bear<br>how come bear never ate anybody’s face off<br>how come barren ever try to bite<br>some dude’s asshole out and bite things<br>I think that that monkey ended up doing that of course<br>not the monkey that was retired here in Los angeles<br>yeah well they always retired when they get older<br>because you can’t control the old males<br>you can’t control them<br>there are merest ancestors or it doesn’t matter<br>if you raise them<br>they’re completely wild<br>you cannot stop that<br>that lady just thought just because<br>she was putting a diaper on this chimp<br>you know and giving it xanax<br>and she would give it wine and shit<br>and I was like a fake boyfriend<br>she had like this fake monkey boyfriend<br>and she thought she had that thing under control<br>then it just decided to eat her friend’s face<br>it’s like I don’t fucking like you<br>I don’t like you he didn’t I mean<br>there was no fight<br>they weren’t brawling<br>she didn’t hit him with a rock it shit into shit<br>attacked her in eight or face<br>whoa<br>I mean even dogs don’t usually do that<br>you know you got a guy who’s got a crazy dog<br>they don’t attack your friends<br>yeah how often does that happen they’ll say kids<br>yeah because they think kids are animals<br>they don’t respect them<br>that all that shit about my cat really freaks me out<br>talking all that shit about my cat killing me<br>cat probably would you kill anything you know<br>have you had a little pet tiny monkey<br>a little monkey like that big<br>would you be safe<br>leaving in the room with this fluffy cat<br>no she wouldn’t murder that thing<br>yeah I’d come home with guts to be all hanging out<br>and she’d be looking at me like she’s my friend<br>hi it would not even like she’s evil<br>poor little monkey with a little monkey family<br>she killed them too little monkey babies merciless<br>I bet she’d be purring rolling around the dead bodies<br>especially with her claws<br>yeah she’s got real claws yeah<br>she’s not declawed he’s declawed<br>they have these things I just found<br>I don’t know if I told you it’s or not<br>where they go over the claw you use glue<br>and he put glue in these little<br>claws and it goes over the claw<br>so they think they have claws<br>still yeah we had brother with him<br>after a while they pop off<br>they pop off yeah pop off quick<br>they pop off<br>keep choosing off too and they say jack and everything<br>oh that sucks yeah<br>would let him keep his claws I don’t care<br>I think it’s<br>I think it’s fucked up to take their claws<br>if you see a YouTube video<br>they actually cut off a knuckle<br>they cut off this part of the knuckle<br>I’m not into that<br>that’s craziness<br>my cat killed a rabbit when it was a kitten damn<br>that’s a rough story asian alien<br>I believe it though cats are ruthless<br>I grew up in a nahud<br>where a crow could talk<br>his name was cr and he would come when called wow<br>you know what<br>if I had never read anything<br>about crows or watched a video and tell<br>I’d be like that guy’s crazy<br>crows coming yeah your pet crow<br>it’s totally the same crow<br>it’s not like they’re all black<br>right you know when they figured out you have food<br>you know I find it weird when people have<br>the worlds as pets or raccoons and stuff<br>raccoons are crazy to see that one<br>video with a raccoon or dog or wrestling yeah<br>like they’re usually fighting to the death<br>I know<br>you know raccoons fuck dogs up man they rip them apart<br>yeah they’re scary animals raccoons they’re mean<br>I see them all the time in my neighborhood<br>raccoons and skunks and rats<br>books<br>we lost to history that I would have changed the world<br>that’s a long article is it good<br>um I’ll check it out<br>all right liz<br>we’re gonna read some questions here one year<br>no cigarettes<br>this guy says<br>all it cost me was a girlfriend<br>the dog she took my waste line and my sanity<br>wow and then you get hit by a bus tomorrow<br>so I guess I’m not gonna smoke<br>you just didn’t deserve the cigarettes after she left<br>you or you couldn’t afford them after she left you<br>or you quit the cigarettes and because<br>you quit the cigarettes you went crazy<br>and you were like agro and then she left you<br>is that what you’re saying<br>then she took the dog<br>you took your waistline but the waistline that’s good<br>right you want to lose some weight<br>probably<br>unless you’re like one of those dudes in the guts<br>apparently there’s a lot of gay dudes<br>they’re really like guys with guts<br>like that<br>they like to have a guy with a big gut in cyrus cock<br>yeah I think they’re like where does lady zack<br>zack got some I think with you know<br>I mean there’s fetishes<br>just like some dudes are like really into feet<br>some dudes are really into like girls with<br>specific type of toenails and what come on girls toes<br>you know<br>I think we gay dudes just get into a certain thing like<br>they see some<br>crazy homophobic trucker<br>he’s all methed out at the truck stop<br>and they just wish they could<br>just suck his cock<br>because he hates them<br>you know he hates them or something about them<br>it just turns the gay guy on<br>that’s my theory<br>that’s a file<br>that guy with this big fat gut and suck that dick what<br>I love people like this<br>they’re somebody just asked you know<br>what they’ve been trying to see or tattoo for three<br>weeks they’ve been asking<br>now<br>wouldn’t you think like you get it online you can see<br>yeah what does it say<br>wouldn’t this person just google<br>if he really cared that much<br>joe rogan tattoo<br>that’s the that’s the kind of people I hate<br>you know it’s like people that<br>well I don’t hate but I hate people<br>when they they they ask me all these questions<br>I’m like man is your fucking google broken<br>that shit happens to me all the time<br>yeah people<br>there’s some people that just don’t have good friends<br>good I’m gonna talk to if lazy fingers<br>you know the only problem with<br>marijuana there is a one problem with marijuana<br>and it’s some of the marijuana community<br>a lot of mooches<br>yeah you know<br>a lot of mooches and dirty hippies<br>brian left listen it’s just you and me now<br>do you think I should get rid of him<br>so I kick him out of the room and just have it<br>all about us<br>say listen man you did your part today katty<br>it’s being my people<br>all this dude is saying<br>I did a job ct dirt says I did a job and these people<br>fed wild raccoons<br>and they scratched at the door like a cat<br>wow that’s crazy<br>that’s nuts man<br>it makes sense I’ve seen squirrels that you can feed<br>there’s a park in north Hollywood<br>and if you bring peanuts<br>if you especially you lie down<br>so the squirrel doesn’t feel like<br>you know<br>you’re in a threatening position to chase after them<br>you know you lie down<br>like on your stomach and you hold up<br>and the fucking scroll will<br>come up to you real gingerly<br>make sure you’re not crazy and he’ll take that peanut<br>and some dudes that the scrolls know really well<br>they’ll just sit right in front of the dude<br>and eat his peanuts<br>like right there like this one<br>there was this one<br>old Chinese guy that apparently goes to the park every<br>day and he brings peanuts<br>and so he’s sitting there with<br>these peanuts these girls are coming right up to him<br>they’re just holding his hand<br>while they’re taking the peanut<br>like he’s their little friend<br>like they’re not worried about him at all<br>it’s kind of crazy okay<br>so<br>by the way did joe<br>this is that new digital camera I reviewed<br>if you guys are<br>here we haven’t seen this before if you ever want<br>to like buy something like and<br>you know that he’s reviewed it<br>you gotta watch his reviews<br>he’s crazy there’s something wrong with him<br>and he gets like super<br>into the technical aspects of anything<br>technology<br>you know like phones and like his reviews of phones<br>he kills those guys at end gadget<br>those bitches you can’t hang with brian<br>the problem<br>is a lot of these websites are getting money<br>yeah you know they’re getting like they’re gonna get<br>we’re not saying that n g aja does no no no<br>but like if they review favorably<br>say like an apple product<br>then the next time apple has a product out<br>they’ll give them like<br>an exclusive because you know right<br>so it’s like a lot of these websites<br>don’t want to bash or tell the truth because<br>they don’t want to ruin future<br>products and something<br>so anyways this is a new camera world works<br>yeah this is a new camera films hd<br>it’s high quality hd 60 frames per 2nd<br>I have the whole review at redband<br>com stereo microphone<br>so if you’re looking for a small digital video camera<br>this shit is what’s the model name brian it’s sony dsc<br>tx seven and<br>red van ridban<br>com I have the whole review there<br>this dude says podcast or in my big girl<br>says podcast from the sensory deprivation tank<br>maybe that would be a fucking cool thing to do<br>you know what I should do it sound like this<br>what it sounds like that it was<br>is there a way<br>that I could have some of the recording sound in there<br>well you know you know it can’t get it wet<br>I mean<br>we could hook and might put a microphone right at<br>to the next to it<br>but I mean<br>it was some old bulls you know and all that stuff<br>because it’s echoing in there<br>yeah but who wants to get<br>oh you mean just lay there and talk yeah<br>well we could just turn off the lights here<br>and you can talk in the dark<br>no no I’m gonna totally do that<br>wouldn’t that just like defeat the purpose<br>of being in a isolation tank<br>no because you’d be too focused on talking to people<br>no no no because it would be talking to people<br>your mind would work so much better than it works with<br>you know sitting<br>in a normal environment like here talking to you and<br>sitting on a couch and the lights and the laptop<br>and all this input coming in<br>you don’t realize how much this has an effect on<br>your ability to like<br>see things clearly<br>and you see things very very clear in that tank<br>and I think if you’re in that tank and you just start<br>talking<br>it’s kind of fucked up a little bit of the experience<br>because you’re gonna hear things<br>you’re gonna hear yourself in both in your ears<br>you’ll hear it in your ears and you hear it in your<br>head you’ve lost your mind joe<br>but I think it’d be kind of cool to do<br>I will do that<br>we’re gonna figure out a way where I can do<br>a podcast someday<br>from the sensory deprivation tech<br>but someday I mean like within a month<br>I don’t mean like<br>when I’m old and ready to die hey gay ban<br>the original question three<br>weeks ago was why does joe not always wear long sleeve<br>well hey retard go google that<br>because I bet you joe’s answer that<br>wow<br>I thought that was totally<br>that would really was on us sir<br>he called me gay band I’m allowed to say something back<br>wow don’t you know<br>that says you’re an asshole but he’s look at<br>I can’t take him seriously because<br>he says brian is a fkk<br>a hole if you ask me<br>well I’m never gonna ask you anything<br>if that’s what you write an fkk<br>a hole that’s really you<br>I can’t talk to you dude<br>brian’s the third wheel how dare you<br>brian’s a very talented video<br>red band has too much negative energy<br>he doesn’t have negative energy<br>these negative energies like the<br>the safest most non dangerous negative energy ever<br>he’s a nice guy leave him alone you fucking creeps<br>why won’t dana let you show your tab in the ufc<br>no it’s not that<br>it’s just it’s a distraction<br>it’s not necessary<br>you know it’s not about me when I’m on the ufc<br>it’s it’s 100% about those dudes that are fighting<br>I just try to do<br>my part my commentary and explain<br>and be enthusiastic and be appreciative<br>but it’s not about me you know<br>that’s why I dress like such a retard<br>I’m not trying to shine<br>I’m wearing a nice suit you know<br>I’m saying looking at my cufflinks<br>look at them diamonds<br>I’m not trying to look good at all<br>I’m just trying to just do my job<br>what’s important is not me<br>what’s important is these<br>these guys fucking throwing their bones at each other<br>in the October it’s not me<br>what kind of weed did we smoke before the show<br>well Mr Federal agent<br>that’s one of the funniest things that I like<br>when someone will ask a stupid question<br>and someone will go like laziest homo ever<br>laziest pedo ever<br>asia’s dea agent ever<br>and it’s like become like a standard<br>like I don’t know who was the first one to do it<br>but I’ve seen it on<br>many forums right<br>I don’t know where it started from<br>but so many people do that<br>now someone will ask a dumb question<br>and someone will chine in<br>you know chime in with that<br>I mean it’s really funny<br>like<br>whenever people ask like drug questions like hey man<br>follow mattel hashe where can I get dmt<br>someone will write laziest D.E.A. age or whatever right<br>it’s become a part of it<br>would you say that’s the lexicon how would you say<br>libernacter there<br>what else bryan is any good questions<br>what kind of weed you smoke before a show man<br>yo you want to smoke<br>kind of weedy guy the kind that comes from California<br>that’s the funny thing that was talking about<br>marijuana supporting these mexican drug details<br>what are you talking about stupid<br>the pot that ibi is bought<br>this guy’s growing it right over there<br>you can go to his house I’ll show you where lips<br>the fuck he talked about<br>he’s not al qaeda and he’s not a mexican drug lord<br>he’s right down the street he’s a nice guy he’s<br>got plants he’ll sell you them<br>he waters him<br>he puts fertilizer and she does a great job<br>the fuck man and it’s great<br>there’s a website called webgarweedtracker<br>com we met those guys in San Francisco<br>but each store has a<br>own forum and so like<br>you like<br>find what stores near your house and then you go to<br>this has like a little website just for that store<br>and every day they’ll say we got trainwrecking and we<br>this is our specials you know and stuff like that<br>and it’s great<br>people review it<br>oh it’s incredible it’s amazing<br>I mean it’s so<br>at this point<br>it’s so free here in California<br>that it literally just like pot is legal<br>it’s just<br>it’s very close right like what’s in between<br>like what’s what’s<br>well they’ve passed one<br>step of a multi step process to making<br>it legal for responsible use<br>for adults over you know probably over 18 or 21<br>I mean it should be over 18<br>I think I think that’s reasonable<br>you know like alcohol I think<br>I think alcohol should be 18 with supervision<br>meaning like you know it should be okay<br>for like your dad to give you a beer<br>when you’re 18 years old<br>you know or you<br>come with your dad to a place<br>where his buddy has a bar<br>and you know just kind of come with a boy<br>his grandma beer<br>he’s never had a beer before<br>you know slowly introduce him<br>into the world to make it like it’s no big deal<br>you learn as you gotta learn how to hold your liquor<br>okay you know<br>understand and learn from your fucking father you know<br>I’m saying like as a young man<br>like let him<br>take away all the mystique of what alcohol really is<br>and that should be the same thing with weed<br>the real problem with anything<br>that affects your mind<br>is that we don’t have enough people<br>out there that are explaining to people<br>how to manage that shit<br>and with alcoholics<br>at least they have alcoholics anonymous and<br>you know they can help<br>guide you back on the right track<br>now there’s no people out there that are telling you<br>you know<br>like explaining to you how to incorporate weed<br>successfully in your life<br>for the maximum benefits<br>you know I mean<br>shit maybe we should write a book about that<br>because it’s a fucking good idea<br>because what really we need in this country<br>and it sounds like all spiritual crazy voodoo<br>but we need shaman<br>and what a shaman is<br>in like in the amazon rainforest<br>the guys who make the iowaska<br>it’s a dude who’s been there done that<br>he’s done it 1000 times he knows what to expect<br>he knows what’s gonna happen<br>he’s not scared of it<br>he enjoys and welcomes the experience<br>he could talk you through it<br>you don’t have to freak the fuck out<br>this guy’s gonna help you<br>he’s gonna sing songs gonna comfort you<br>they’re gonna play the drums<br>and you’re gonna get to talk to dead people<br>you know I mean that’s what it is<br>it’s a shaman and we need a shaman for marijuana<br>and we really could use a shaman for alcohol too<br>this should be someone who<br>culturally explains the group<br>I mean it should be like<br>expressed as an<br>ethic through the entire human community<br>that there’s it’s wrong<br>to be drunk and obnoxious<br>and be a fucking douchebag and ruin other<br>people’s good time<br>and it should be something we all agree upon<br>shouldn’t be something funny<br>like oh<br>maybe at a time you got drunk and rip that girl shirt<br>a ha<br>that should be horrifying to everyone involved<br>we should and<br>all that is is the reason why we don’t address that is<br>we have this crazy way of looking at drugs<br>we look at drugs like some higher than they’re all bad<br>like they’re all under<br>this same<br>is one gigantic carpet of everything’s bad for you<br>look it’s not necessarily bad for you<br>it’s only bad for some people<br>it’s good for some people<br>the experiences benefit you<br>they make your life more interesting<br>should this shawman be driving while giving advice<br>no so that’s a problem<br>if you get 18 year old<br>that person just got their licensed tears ago<br>they don’t know how to fucking drive<br>you know they drive reckless yeah they drive too<br>fast and they’re not good at it that was me<br>I was terrible driver when I was young<br>so lucky I don’t have a dwi<br>yeah yeah yeah do you ever get one<br>no never got one ad how<br>yeah I never drove that drunk but I probably could have<br>like you know the legal limit is like<br>I try to do one beer now pretty much it’s one bear<br>yeah yeah if you have one<br>beer and you get pulled over 20min later<br>yeah I bet you probably getting there<br>yeah maybe if you the support in line<br>for then a half an hour<br>the second beer right<br>that’s crazy but<br>with a lot of people that’s good man<br>you really should they really shouldn’t be driving<br>anthony from opian<br>anthony has a really interesting point<br>it’s like what if I’m good when I drive drunk<br>but that’s not a good point if you kill a kid<br>you know you slam into a family<br>well I would say I’m better than average driving drunk<br>but you know<br>there’s no test for that you know<br>unfortunately they came to sit down go okay<br>you got to play fucking pole position<br>for an hour and showing skills<br>that’s another thing<br>about marijuana is that people<br>are just more cautious when they’re on it<br>you know people think that marijuana affects your<br>your reaction<br>it doesn’t it really doesn’t<br>I smoke where I want it and I do jujitsu all the time<br>so does eddie bravo so like a bunch of different<br>like really<br>high level brazilian jujitsu guys like forget about me<br>I know guys that are like<br>world championship black belts that love to get high<br>and then go do jujitsu<br>like it makes them connected to the movements better<br>it makes you very coordinated when you’re high<br>but it’s more<br>like we were talking about earlier with like<br>being paranoid paranoia<br>it’s like too much information<br>you don’t know how to manage it<br>it’s not that it’s a bad thing<br>it’s so you’re just getting too much info<br>you’re not keeping up with it<br>that’s where it all comes from<br>dan check this out<br>his this dude’s cousin was going to jail<br>but after having two duty<br>two duis but the policeman that arrested him died<br>so now you know there’s no<br>you know proof or whatever oh wow<br>so<br>that’s crazy look<br>for everybody but the cop yeah<br>joe you gonna be in celebrity rehab the next few years<br>oh totally have you watched that show<br>yes<br>I watched one episode because stanhope was mocking Dr<br>Drew and I said I let me check this out<br>it’s like wow what a train wreck<br>I mean it’s great it’s fun to watch<br>I’m addicted to anything<br>that I don’t think I could stop<br>I don’t have a problem with anything right now<br>I used to have<br>you know my real problem is never been drugs<br>my real problem is<br>games<br>I have a serious addiction to like video games and<br>to pool pool I think is a little bit more meditation<br>because it’s like a lot of hand dock coordination<br>and you have to<br>steadier nerves and it’s all<br>you know controlling the ball<br>but I get obsessed with games<br>like when I get when I play I used to play quake<br>and I used to play no bullshit 8h a day<br>at least every day I was online<br>I loved it and I’m avoiding that on purpose<br>so if I had like<br>a thing that I needed to kick at any point in my life<br>it was never drugs<br>drugs weren’t ruining my life<br>but video games were kind of ruining my life<br>not ruining it but they were<br>it was becoming an obsession<br>the problem is I enjoyed the fuck out of it<br>quake is so goddamn fun<br>you know veer tried to quit caffeine though<br>what’s up you ever tried to quit caffeine<br>yeah I’ve quit caffeine<br>that shit’s hard<br>it is hard you know<br>when I realized I needed to quit<br>I was writing a blog a day<br>you know that one time before I<br>filmed my special I wrote a blog every day<br>so I was up every night<br>really late because that’s when I write my best shit<br>so every night I was drinking coffee like 10:00<br>oh and I was I mean this kind of coffee too<br>I don’t fuck around I<br>use a French press<br>know it’s like I grind my own coffee<br>you know you get<br>a bird grinder and I give these beans only from<br>these cona beans from Hawaii or my favorite<br>this coffee will<br>fuck your world up<br>this shit is strong<br>and I would take it at like 10:00 at night<br>and man I couldn’t get to bed until five<br>six o’clock in the morning<br>and then when I finally did crash<br>I felt like shit the next day<br>and I did it a bunch of days in a row<br>then I tried to stop<br>and when I tried to stop I got these serious headaches<br>like dull<br>like pressing headaches<br>like it didn’t even feel like coffee could fix them<br>it felt like I<br>just like I short circuited in my brain or something<br>no fuck is calling me oh podcast<br>fuck kind of bullshit<br>my apologies ladies and gentlemen<br>don’t you feel less energy doing<br>exercising after you smoke weed<br>no I’m the opposite<br>especially if it’s a good sativa that’s what<br>people that are outside of California<br>most of what you’re getting is called indica<br>and indica is a very<br>different kind of marijuana than sativa<br>there’s two types<br>there’s indica which is like relax couch weeds<br>oh dude just go and chill you know what I’m saying<br>that’s og kush weed<br>that’s the weed that makes you want to eat<br>and fuck up your diet<br>man fuck the diet you know but<br>sativa is I want to watch a documentary sativa is<br>you know you want to watch<br>the cosmos and see carl sagan on tv and<br>carl sagan by the way smoke pot every day<br>that was the shit<br>and carl sagan was a huge activist and advocate of<br>marijuana and enhancing perceptions with it<br>bitch this guy<br>the chit I<br>understand that you and bryan had a little falling out<br>okay<br>let’s just be nice fella there’s no need to get crazy<br>people are

you’re gonna go back<br>go back I think just because it’s fun<br>but what if someone sends you a picture of video<br>on your phone<br>some asshole oh<br>my god I can’t believe this<br>check this out all those do that now yeah you know<br>why did they go with at amp t<br>well you don’t have to<br>you know no it’s a verizon well here’s the thing<br>no one’s thinking of this they have those mi fi’s now<br>so you just have your mi fi<br>that’s verizon network<br>and now you have verizon anywhere you go<br>you know<br>really yeah they have these boxes that connect<br>and then broadcast wireless<br>it’s called my fight membrase showed you them right<br>they’re about this big<br>so if you have a little case like a satua<br>you have your ipad in<br>just have that throw that in there<br>turn it on and you have verizon wherever you go<br>look at this motherfucker<br>just hacking the sista bitches yeah<br>and that’s another thing that’s gonna be<br>big man purses are gonna have to come back<br>because of this thing<br>you know man purses you’re a big advocate of<br>the man I love<br>I actually bought a domain name<br>I told you I was addicted to domain names<br>I bought ipad sling<br>so have you know anyone that’s what’s the buy those<br>oh shit<br>you know anyone that makes purses<br>all right just my laptop<br>no I don’t know anybody who makes purses goddamn<br>I don’t wear a man yeah man<br>those man pouch<br>those man bags they look like a fucking purse to me<br>fanny pack looks like a manly choice<br>fanny pack doesn’t though you man your fanny pack<br>put that bitch in<br>all your stuff is right there<br>somebody wants something<br>you just unzip and you get it too much right there<br>see I like my little<br>man purse that look because it’s made for guns<br>so it looks like a gunsatua but it will fit the ipad<br>so<br>doesn’t announce for a gun looks announced for jewelry<br>no it makes it<br>I have a review of that somewhere sticking mirrors here<br>yeah but you like<br>like stepdad style you got like the big that<br>hey let’s go to<br>the you know disney big manly ass fucking fanny pack<br>I like fanny pack so wear them all time you should have<br>a company and then you can also sell ice or ipad sling<br>I don’t want to sell the ipad sling but<br>not buying the ipad<br>but I if I didn’t have a kindle<br>I would see what you’re saying<br>but what if you want to<br>buy a portable dvd player for the car or something<br>you’re like you want a good one though<br>it’s like wouldn’t you pay a little<br>extra if you could download the movies<br>while you’re in the car<br>okay first of all<br>how dope would it be if you had a screen in your car<br>that’s that big<br>no you can’t do that<br>you can make that screen in your car<br>and install it as a screen<br>yeah you could totally do that was<br>think that on the way over<br>imagine that gps<br>that might be the greatest thing ever<br>and it’s got bluetooth so<br>many inches is that it’s 9.7 inches across<br>it’s so thin<br>they could just sit fit it right in your car<br>you feel that your dashboard fitted for it right<br>whoa you know<br>what’s really funny is a lot of people are<br>bashing on it<br>that’s not wide screen<br>well alright<br>there’s gonna be the bar on the top and the bottom so<br>they wanted it wide screen so what do you mean<br>they wanted us to<br>they wanted them to chop off<br>like the top and bottom or would make it bigger<br>if you make it bigger<br>then that thing would be this big but widescreen<br>so it’s like a letterbox thing<br>when you watch a video you see a little blacks right<br>but that’s what they had to do<br>that’s what they had to do<br>people don’t get wide screen<br>they don’t get it<br>it definitely is better to have something that you can<br>read books and watch movies on<br>if you look at it that way<br>but the way I am video games<br>still’s not that appealing to me because<br>I already have a laptop<br>and if I’m gonna spend time like<br>what is it gonna give me that the laptop’s not going to<br>I can watch movies on the laptop<br>and which movies on that<br>what else can I do<br>I get online on that I get line on a laptop better<br>so what am I doing with it<br>the applications reeling<br>am I no alright it’s the size of a book<br>so what they’re saying is that what if you use it<br>like you have a<br>razor phone in your pocket<br>you go into the comedy club and you have this little<br>thing the size of a little milk pad<br>it’s in a little leather pad<br>you can keep that bitch in your pocket<br>you’re gonna pretend that you’re gonna<br>carry that thing around with you everywhere<br>well no no you throw it in the car<br>it’s like it looks like a little book<br>it’s a little book you know<br>so you throw in the car<br>so that you could use it when you’re out<br>when you’re out<br>if you have it<br>like steve jobs<br>it’s like people can bring those things to restaurants<br>and instead of texting<br>you’re gonna be seeing their little books<br>yeah little books<br>doing little g emails<br>checking their calendars<br>steve jobs you best<br>I think people are basting them<br>freaking out of it because there’s a couple things<br>that<br>it doesn’t do off like it doesn’t do flashing stuff<br>but that’s another reason<br>steve jobs is fucking this up<br>I think what’s that reason<br>market people are gonna go crazy for it<br>it’s technology<br>all right let’s read some questions from these people<br>gears of war fuck yeah that that game is awesome<br>that’s another game I’m scared of that game<br>I don’t want to get locked in that world<br>of playing that shit online every day<br>too fun man remember<br>we got a chance to see that early on<br>we got a chance we were in<br>North Carolina and I met cliffy b from epic games<br>and he got us in and we gotta look at<br>the models of gears of war way before it was released<br>it was fucking crazy<br>and the new stuff they’re working on<br>like these new enemies<br>they’re so insane<br>like he showed us a demo<br>some of this stuff<br>and the guys that id software did too<br>tim willets<br>and todd holling’s head and<br>john karmac and those guys those guys are super cool<br>they let us come and check out all the new<br>stuff they’re doing<br>that’s my favorite all time game is quick<br>but like I said I’m scared<br>you know that there’s a<br>they did a report on<br>browser crashes on computers yeah and I<br>think it was 85% of all browser crashes<br>were because of flash<br>whoa that’s a big number<br>whoa 85 because other than flash<br>you got javascript you got a couple things but<br>85% if that’s crazy like how is that allowed<br>well people talk that’s just it<br>people are freaking out about something<br>that’s a plug in<br>you know html five point nodes about to come out<br>which will make<br>flask pretty much unnecessary<br>what how does it make flash on this<br>well it’s the problem is<br>they started using flashback in the day<br>because that was an easy way to take video<br>put it on the internet so anyone can watch it because<br>people’s internet connections kind of sucked and<br>it was in one format<br>what html five point no does is pretty much to make<br>I think it’s htwo 0. six four<br>video will just play in the browser<br>kind of like how a gif<br>works you know like animated gif will work<br>no matter what<br>because it’s made in the coding of the browser<br>so this will make videos and stuff like that<br>just be in the coding and just work right now so<br>and guess who’s guess who’s making<br>are editing the html 0.5 point oh<br>coding this is kind of interesting<br>a guy that works at google<br>and the guy that works at apple<br>so you have long had this theory<br>that there’s a battle going on between<br>apple and flash and you think that one of<br>the reasons why apple<br>has such a hard time working with flashes<br>and make it shitty on purpose<br>so that people move away from flash<br>well I think that’s a<br>good theory definitely but<br>the big thing is is that like<br>no one in silicon valley works together<br>like amazon and apple and they’re all<br>not working together as a team<br>right they’re all like having to fight<br>and do and you know<br>like the opposite of what this person’s doing<br>like like if flash releases a new plug in<br>you know that works with firefox<br>or whatever that doesn’t work for safari<br>they’re trying to work for safari<br>but safari changes something<br>and then fucks all their shit up<br>you know it’s constantly like that with everything<br>in silicon valley cause they don’t work together<br>they don’t work together<br>they just think it’s odd that they’re working together<br>you sensing a conspiracy brian<br>it’s so pleased<br>I’m sensing<br>flash is getting pushed out for some reason<br>mostly because of the security reasons it’s very<br>open for you can get hacked and security<br>with flash and stuff like that<br>and I think it’s getting pushed out<br>especially when html five point out comes out which is<br>probably coming soon<br>html five point out<br>can’t do what flash does buddy<br>and it’s proprietary kodak<br>what this is what this guy says filbert double o seven<br>yeah<br>go go google search html five point o<br>go look at wikipi or whatever and<br>it would even explain it in there<br>it’s pretty much<br>known that once html five point o comes out<br>that flash for the most part<br>is going to be hurtin hmm okay<br>well the gauntlet’s been thrown down a challenge<br>has been made<br>YouTube has already switched over<br>to all their videos to five point out<br>what is this guy’s asking what is so as vimeo vimeo<br>com I believe just switched over to<br>to five point already meaning that’s why<br>YouTube now works on your iphone<br>cola saying this guy’s asking a question<br>what’s with the sensoring on this social message board<br>does what is the sensor<br>it’s like if you try to Twitter something<br>and you swear<br>or on this will it<br>change it<br>maybe<br>is that why that guy wrote that’s fucking like that<br>oh maybe I don’t know<br>is that true folks you can’t swear on this<br>it’s probably a setting if there is<br>it has to be a setting<br>please tell me it’s a setting<br>that is you know<br>people don’t think that’s a big deal<br>like I always<br>make a big deal out of the fact that<br>you know censorship with certain words<br>you know and people say that what’s the big deal<br>you know why do you have to be rude why can’t you just<br>you know not say those particular words or in your own<br>certain people<br>or in certain situations like<br>that’s a way of controlling us it’s nonsense it makes<br>no sense whatsoever<br>words don’t mean anything other than intention<br>what’s important<br>is that you’re expressing your intention<br>you’re expressing what<br>you’re thinking that the idea of magic words is<br>it’s poison to the language<br>it’s terrible<br>to have words that you can’t use or on certain people<br>and you can’t use<br>when you broadcast them you would be giving<br>you find hundreds of thousands of dollars<br>that is just a gigantic distraction<br>that’s complete total mind control<br>it’s a technique<br>that they’re using to try to control the population<br>there’s no other way around it<br>why else’s censorship is what it offends people<br>why does it offend people<br>you don’t have to listen to it<br>the government’s going after it<br>why are they going after it<br>they’re going after it<br>because some people<br>are very offended by whether it’s religious people<br>or you know really conservative people<br>but why why are they offended by it<br>it’s nonsense it’s a fucking huge distraction<br>it’s just a word<br>whether you say I fucked her or I had sex with her<br>you can’t say I fucked her<br>like is that really hurting someone’s feelings<br>so so what happened<br>on the<br>you know the night that you proposed to your wife<br>well I fucked her<br>you know I mean is that it bad<br>well it’s actually her<br>it’s the same thing you’re saying the same thing<br>like it’s not offending me if you say you fucked her<br>you know if you say ah<br>that fucking hurt I’m not gonna get<br>why would I be upset<br>what kind of a douche bag gets upset<br>if you stub your toe and you go<br>ah that fucking hurt<br>ugh who gets mad at that<br>who the fuck things that’s wrong to say<br>that’s it’s a trick<br>yeah<br>but if we didn’t do that then words wouldn’t be power<br>as powerful as they are now<br>it would be just as powerful if you use it<br>and then you’re like fuck you<br>you’re like whatever I heard<br>fuck you five times a day<br>you hear fucking five times they already do<br>that’s the problem<br>if it was like some exotic word that nobody used<br>like cunt still has a good amount of zing to it<br>it’s the only one you know other than racial epitaphs<br>there has to be a way to turn off the censoring thing<br>right<br>I don’t know laser java is there a way to turn it off<br>the social stream appears to be censored<br>because why would they censored that<br>but yet I could say<br>fuck cunt bag right now<br>and that’s even worse thing I don’t know<br>man<br>it’s how you say it this man says<br>what I let my kid first<br>fuck yeah it’s just words god damn it<br>people are so weird wow you really are censored<br>I don’t see a single swear no

shaman<br>we need someone who has<br>a leader’s way of seeing the world<br>someone who sees it outside of this<br>crazy predetermined pattern that we’re on right now<br>you know I mean I wrote this article about<br>it’s on my blog about the large<br>hydron collider and how crazy it is<br>that like at a certain point<br>time science got to this weird point and I’m not<br>trashing it in any way because<br>I’m fascinated by technology<br>I’m just making an observation<br>that when we first started inventing things it was<br>to improve the quality of our life<br>you know<br>we invented spears that we didn’t have to chase after<br>the animals and bite them with our teeth<br>you know we invented things<br>we invented houses so we survived under the rain<br>but at a certain point time<br>it got completely<br>past that and now<br>even though we have all sorts of things<br>to deal with with the human race<br>like poverty and<br>what’s going on in Haiti and Liberia<br>the vice guide to Liberia<br>if you haven’t seen that document<br>god damn<br>these fucking dudes went to Liberia which is this<br>crazy nation in africa that has like<br>rampant cannibalism<br>like people are constantly killing each other<br>and eating each other<br>they’re selling human meat on the street<br>I mean this one dude talked about he was this warlord<br>they called him<br>general butt naked<br>and this fucking crazy guy would<br>kill babies and talks about it<br>how he would kill innocent children<br>from the opposing tribe<br>or whoever the fuck they were at war with<br>cut out their heart<br>and they would all eat the heart<br>and they would strengthen them<br>for battle and make them invulnerable to bullets<br>he ate a lot of people<br>I mean this guy talks openly about eating people<br>about what you eat<br>if you’re hungry for hunger you eat like the soft part<br>like the stomach and<br>the inside of the thigh cause it’s tender<br>I mean he’s talking about like what you<br>eat I’m a part of a person<br>he was talking about<br>we turned this guy in who he was eating street food<br>like he bought some<br>chicken skewers or something<br>and it was human meat<br>and he could tell because he’s eaten it so many times<br>so he explained to the police this guy’s<br>like serving human food and you have him arrested<br>and now the guys like a crazy evangelist<br>and he like he like preaches and fellows<br>he’s killed thousands<br>what’s the name of that documentary<br>the vice guide to Liberia<br>yeah<br>texts that are twit that a lot of people are asking now<br>jesus christ I gotta twist that<br>I mean<br>one of the craziest fucking things I’ve ever seen<br>you know<br>what’s weird is that obama still struggles with his<br>cigarette

video of somebody opening up<br>50 apps at once and it’s still<br>playing neat versus yeah<br>hey you guys put up a contest for people to be<br>on your show laziest stalker ever<br>let’s do it<br>is

doing mark gaden’s not that funny yeah<br>must be angry almadeus<br>did I watch the state of the union<br>any thoughts I didn’t watch it<br>did you watch it<br>what state of the union yeah who cares<br>you know<br>it’s almost like at this point time I thought that<br>right before obama got elected you know<br>when when you know looked like he was gonna win<br>I was like wow this is so crazy like<br>this guy’s gonna win like this<br>it really felt like things were gonna change<br>you know it really felt like wow maybe<br>voting is real you know this guy can get an office<br>he’s got a black guy from a single mom and<br>you know and the way he says he’s gonna<br>get everybody out of a gannistan<br>and get everybody out of Iraq<br>and meanwhile his name<br>well he also said when he was running like<br>this is a long road<br>you know I’m got a lot of my road<br>he never said it was gonna be quick<br>like even when he was you know<br>he said this the whole time<br>troops tough gas town yeah you know<br>and I don’t I’m not a military expert<br>but what we have to look at for real<br>is we have real problems at home<br>we have real mean<br>when you look at the enemy<br>you look at attacks on america<br>like there’s this big giant distraction<br>that the big fear is things we have to work about<br>worry about from other nations from<br>all over the place<br>there’s a lot of crime and violence<br>in america that we got to worry about<br>before we worry about crime you know<br>a giant group called the taliban<br>acting to kill americans worry about the thousands of people<br>that we kill every<br>day and how the fuck do we put a stop to that shit<br>how do we put a stop to senseless violent crime in america<br>and then we gotta deal with the fact that we’re right<br>next door to mexico<br>and mexico is way crazier that iraq and afghanistan combined<br>more people get murdered in mexico than anywhere in the world<br>the dwaran drugs in mexico at there’s<br>five times more casualties this year<br>something like that victor dabula the guy who does the<br>the spanish version of my job for the ufc<br>great god he was living in war as<br>and he told me<br>it was some crazy statistic you’ll have to google it<br>but it was like<br>five times more people died<br>in<br>war is in one year then died in the ira war i mean it’s nuts man<br>they’re just<br>killing people left and right down there and the reason<br>why they’re doing it is because<br>there’s so much<br>money in selling illegal drugs to the united states from mexico<br>i mean it’s incredible these guys get<br>so goddamn rich and they’re fighting over<br>so much that the violence is insane<br>and they’re killing police officers and<br>politicians and<br>they brought over fucking<br>tanks and shit<br>and they got tanks run through the streets and war<br>as i mean this<br>shit is happening<br>literally into a country that’s connected to us<br>you can fucking drive there<br>it’s not you don’t have to fly<br>halfway across the world<br>to deal with some conflict whereas the enemy is there<br>the enemy is anybody who’s murdering people alright<br>anybody who’s<br>so fucking crazy<br>they’re killing five times more people than dying a war<br>i mean it’s right there that’s a war<br>there’s a war that we’re not even involved is connected to us<br>it’s fucking dangerous<br>they’re getting rich as shit and they have tanks and<br>who knows what they’re gonna get i mean in mexico<br>you could probably buy jets you know<br>they could probably buy like<br>fucking us army jets from russia<br>who the fuck knows<br>they have billions and billions and billions of<br>i mean they’re so rich it’s a scary shit man very scary shit<br>we’re worried about what’s going on in afghanistan<br>but the problem is there’s money in afghanistan<br>there’s natural gas<br>there’s money in the oil and iraq there’s oil<br>controlling the natural gas pipeline the reason<br>why people have been trying to get to afghanistan over and over<br>again for so many years where the soviets invaded them<br>they’re trying to get the resources<br>whenever we fuck with other countries<br>we’re trying to get their resources that’s it<br>in the future<br>with the electric cars do you think people are going to be<br>blowing up radio shacks<br>and like protect the radio

during his campaign<br>he said he sees no evidence for that<br>you know that<br>and it makes you wonder<br>how much do you think they really know<br>how much do you think i mean who<br>the fuck does obama answer to what happens when you actually<br>get an office a cat<br>that’s the secret there’s this really smart cat<br>it’s an educated cat with a golden headdress<br>and it just hits there<br>obama you must don’t make me turn you an assault bitch yeah<br>what do you think happens when they get in there<br>i mean do they meet with the heads of these<br>gigantic corporation that spends millions of dollars on their<br>campaign they must they must you know<br>i mean that’s one of the things that they said about bush<br>that bush met with<br>the heads of all these different<br>energy companies and oil companies<br>and it’s like common practice that like<br>it’s common knowledge rather that<br>policy was dictated after he had these meanings like<br>they had worked it out<br>but that’s what i mean how does<br>anybody not expect that if you pay people<br>millions of dollars<br>you give them millions of dollars of your money<br>to get them into office once they’re an office<br>i mean you bribe them<br>i mean you bribed them mm hmm<br>why would you else you spend millions of dollars<br>i mean if you’re you know an oil company why<br>why you given politicians all this money<br>because you want them to like take it easy on you<br>you want to you’re bribing them<br>it’s nuts i mean it’s crazy that that’s legal<br>it’s great and the supreme court recently just stopped<br>the cap on spending on it<br>they said that<br>they’re like they treated them as an individual<br>that are corporations like an individual so<br>they could spend as much money on<br>campaigns they want that’s crazy<br>they’re gonna have all kinds of nutty ass<br>commercials like that talking dog<br>commercial that they came up with keeping it<br>obama is put a<br>spending freeze though on<br>a lot of the money<br>last week i thought that was the whole thing<br>i don’t know he probably talked about it last night well<br>you know<br>he was horrified by it i’m sure he was talking about it<br>but i think that’s also<br>just because people<br>were horrified by it i think they just got so greedy<br>and horrific<br>that they needed to take a step back they go listen<br>we fucked up this is<br>like this is like<br>you know people<br>might storm the white house with guns this is getting crazy<br>like now<br>you know even people that run the corporations are like really<br>they’re gonna let us do this<br>this is is this<br>democracy is this really with the united states has found it on<br>you stream this week doesn’t seem like it’s been fucking up<br>has it been fucking up at all no<br>you stream looks fine this week does anybody have a problem<br>with we were ready to jump ship<br>dirty bitches maybe it was a storm last week<br>maybe that it could have been the storm last week<br>it could have been<br>this you know<br>obama did right after<br>the budgets got increased by thirty five percent<br>that’s what this guy says obama did what<br>what was the question<br>we’re saying that obama<br>put a cap on the spending<br>he did after the budget get increased by thirty five percent<br>so they increased it<br>so they changed it by thirty five percent and then he put a cap<br>on it so it made it look like he was doing anything<br>to stop it but really they didn’t is that what you’re saying<br>well it seems like<br>the spending freeze is in two thousand eleven he said<br>it’s all fucking nuts<br>yeah and that’s why i don’t follow this stupid chance it’s it’s<br>it’s so<br>complex politics are so complex that at certain point in time<br>you have to like look at your resources<br>you have to look at your life and go how much time do<br>i have to deal with this shit how much time do<br>i have to take care of my children<br>to pay my bills to manage my career<br>to go to the gym to hang out with my friends<br>play a couple games of pool how much fucking time<br>do you have in a day and that’s why<br>they can just fuck you and keep fucking you that’s why<br>these<br>cigarette and alcohol companies get away with contributing<br>millions of dollars to a partnership for a drug<br>free america<br>and then they make commercials like the one with a talking dog<br>that tells the girdle stop smoking weed<br>it’s just corruption and it’s<br>blatant and it’s right in front of our eyes<br>i mean the system is so fucked up<br>that it’s almost like<br>someone else has to come in and fix it<br>it’s almost like we’re like lord of the flies<br>just a giant large scale version of it and we’re just<br>fucking going crazy<br>you know we’re allowing corporations and<br>these dudes to make millions and millions dollars<br>just by fucking us<br>all this stimulus money<br>that went to all these<br>banks that they don’t have to account for<br>it’s fucking chaos i mean that is a mad grab for cash<br>where dudes are saying well<br>we gotta give them their bonuses we don’t give them<br>their bonuses they’re gonna leave they’re gonna leave<br>so that’s why they should get millions of dollars at taxpayers<br>money while the whole economy melts in front everybody’s eyes<br>like that’s incredible they’re so<br>bold that they’re want they want bonuses<br>while everything’s falling apart and going under<br>because they have contracts<br>and then they say whoa we’re gonna lose them<br>to other corporations like no<br>you’re supposed to lose them you’re fucking bangfield stupid<br>holy shit i mean it’s amazing how just blatant they are<br>it’s almost like it’s so<br>corrupt that nothing’s gonna fix it and i feel like<br>when i think about investing my time<br>and trying to pay attention to it<br>or<br>got for fucking bid trying to do something to fix it it’s like<br>it’s so fucked up<br>it would take a hundred lives of a hundred people living<br>a hundred lives just to bring it back to baseline<br>just to bring it back to no corruption<br>you know politics in america are so fucked up and corrupt<br>and when i talk to people that really know about it<br>like i know some dudes<br>who run some big businesses<br>and i’ve talked to them about politics about what you know<br>real what campaigns<br>and what contributing is really all about it’s fucking<br>horrifying it’s horrifying<br>it should be all illegal<br>it should be illegal for politicians to talk<br>while someone else writes their speeches totally illegal<br>there’s no way you should be a guy reading a goddamn script<br>written by twenty experts in english and<br>you know in the right way to phrase things and great writers<br>you know how to<br>you know mimic<br>some of the responses that people got to<br>historical speeches you know like<br>teddy roosevelt was in him<br>similar situation and this is what he said<br>and i think we need to address that<br>and the founding father is this country really<br>new past we need to address that<br>and they<br>calculated so perfectly to make you interesting<br>we don’t even know who the fuck obama is<br>we know<br>that he’s pretty cool common collected but you know until<br>you see a dude you know<br>that<br>till we have obama doesn’t write a lot of his own shit<br>though you got to give him that<br>but it’s all nonsense anyway<br>if he was talking like that in your house<br>you would think he’s crazy<br>what we need to do as a nation<br>and as individuals and you’d be like<br>why can’t he just talk to us<br>why do they have to talk like that<br>why can’t they get on stage and go listen<br>there’s a certain age group that’s almost dead<br>but once they die i think we’re going to be like that i think<br>so i think so too i think it’s just an age group that<br>that if we<br>didn’t do that then people would be like what the fuck you know<br>maybe eating thirty years of presents gonna be like<br>you are you know<br>i think you got a good point yeah<br>i think you got a good point i think that’s real possible<br>i mean that age groups just gotta go<br>and once they’re gone weeds<br>gonna be legal everybody before the internet pre internet oh<br>my god you know if you didn’t embrace the internet<br>god you’re just you’re you’re riding on a buggy man<br>you’re riding on an animal you know<br>all that that i mean<br>can’t we have a president that gets on stage and<br>talks like a normal human he raps this is the no<br>i mean a guy who gets on stage and goes well<br>here’s our situation right<br>you ever seen that guy<br>rate kurtz will explain<br>technological<br>the singularity and their exponential increase in technology<br>the ways explains it is like a regular dude<br>he’s not talking about it<br>like it’s the future god bless america right<br>he’s not getting all crazy and dramatic and theatrical<br>he’s just giving you information<br>but it’s weird that people<br>feel like they just have to do that like alex jones even<br>but that’s it’s a fake drama i don’t mind real drama<br>i don’t mind if the guy’s talking<br>if i feel like he’s and you could tell that sincerity<br>and that’s one of the reasons why they put on that<br>so obvious fake voice<br>because it masks in sincerity<br>that’s what’s the most offensive about politician speeches<br>when if they had to talk<br>if they had to go up there and go well what i want to do is i<br>want first of all<br>i want to end this war i’m trying to figure out how<br>we’ve got to get out of afghanistan<br>first thing we’re gonna do is we’re gonna set up iraq<br>we’re gonna get out there and<br>if he said it like a guy who was just talking to you<br>you would be able to see where the bullshit is<br>but by masking it in political speech in that speech<br>you know that mode that speaks<br>predetermined broadcasters and everyone that we<br>stand at a crossroads<br>and when they talk like that it’s<br>agreed that it’s gonna sound like bullshit<br>and it masks bullshit<br>i just thought that up too<br>these casters totally tweet that so i remember<br>cause that’s a bit there’s a bit in there somewhere right<br>yeah was a bit in there somewhere<br>that’s why they speak speeches like that because<br>you would if they were speaking like a regular person<br>you another foolish yeah<br>but why do the news people and radio stations have to do it<br>because they’re trying to get that paper<br>you know what what<br>if you wants to use was like dude<br>there was a fire today check this shit out<br>we filmed this on main street<br>look at this building that’s all fucked up<br>first of all it’s really hard<br>for people to be themselves on camera it takes a long time<br>but they trained them to be that way<br>they trained them to have that voice<br>that’s why the weather person<br>and the traffic person in every city<br>all sound the same<br>they’re on radio<br>we have to have the certain<br>that’ll mainstream well<br>it looks like got clear sailing on the four oh<br>five yeah<br>they have a certain way of doing it because that’s you know<br>it’s sort of like strip club dj’s too it’s like yeah<br>they’re nervous so they fall into this pattern because it makes<br>them more comfortable<br>some some stand up comedians sound like that too<br>you know some sound of comedians like<br>you can tell like they’re trying to sound<br>like a comic like that was a big thing in the eighties<br>there was a bunch of guys who weren’t saying jack shit<br>but they were saying it like comics<br>and they would get laughs there’s a few guys on on nature names<br>but the eighties was real easy for shitty comedy<br>a lot of guys like slip through<br>because there was so much comedy going on<br>and they never learned how to talk as themselves<br>they were always like the wacky comedy voice guy<br>do do do do do for our twenty oh it’s already got four time<br>is it it for twenty food time<br>you guys ever talk about<br>michael lee and hart appointed the repair of the dea no<br>i don’t know you know what it’s like<br>it’s the same thing as like open up the doors to mexico<br>it’s like<br>i don’t know the solution and the problem with the dea is<br>really yeah they shouldn’t be<br>busting people for pot<br>pot should be legal<br>but there are some drugs that are fucking terrible for you<br>you know these real drugs are terrible for you<br>and a lot of them are sold by fucking pharmacies<br>all right how about oxycontin you got real problems<br>what’s that thing we were talking about earlier<br>the oxycontin express<br>but these dea guys<br>and all these they have families they have jobs you know<br>and this is what they’re doing and<br>a lot of them signed up to do the right<br>thing to try to protect communities<br>and then they get involved in it and i think<br>that’s when things get squirrely<br>and you know you do realize that yeah<br>it is kind of fucking silly that i could tell a guy<br>can’t do this and i’m gonna lock him in a cage<br>and you think you’re doing okay<br>because you’re just doing your job well<br>if they make pot legal<br>fit that’s fifty percent of the fuck of people who had prison<br>for non violent drug offenses do you just immediately<br>cancel out all their<br>their their cases and let them out or do you say no<br>you live in the dark ages<br>so you’re fucked you know<br>you lived in the ages when it was illegal<br>i mean you’d have to let everybody out of jail<br>you’d have to let like half the people out of jail<br>what that’s crazy<br>they’re all fucked up now they’ve been in jail and they’re all<br>hard they’ve been there for five years they’re fucking angry<br>unless you’re gonna pay them<br>how you gonna let them out of jail<br>you gonna give them millions of dollars<br>they got all sue okay<br>so now you got<br>millions of people<br>who want millions of dollars<br>you don’t think the economy is fucked now<br>let people out make<br>pot illegal or make pot legal let people out of jail<br>make the dea closed down<br>because you’re not gonna go after drugs<br>fuck<br>it’s like the the web we have already woven it’s so polluted<br>it’s so hard to<br>to extradite yourself from it<br>that’s the right where it’s trying to be smart<br>imagination of you know i’m saying like try to be<br>immaculate with my structure<br>of my linguistics you’re doing a fake speech think<br>yeah i was doing a fake speech thing<br>what’s the sickest thing you’ve ever seen you brother<br>i

them<br>broadcast is the new radio i think it is man<br>i really do i think that this is the future i think<br>you know i think that what<br>the only thing that’s separating this<br>from from regular radio is you don’t have this in your car<br>yet and that’s coming<br>it’s diversity come up with internet capable<br>car stereos and<br>you’re gonna be able to download podcast<br>directly to it and a lot of people<br>they have setups in their car<br>where they have an ipod and they just<br>they download people’s podcast on their ipod then they set up<br>where they the<br>blog broadcast their ipod through their<br>car stereo speaker<br>lot of you have that right<br>i sit in my car and automatically connects to my iphone<br>and then i have my whole itunes on my iphone<br>play through my sink on ford see<br>that’s what i’m talking about that’s the goddamn future<br>and it’s gonna be just like a dvr<br>so you know how you get<br>you know your tv shows<br>i mean how often you watch tv shows when they air only<br>if you’re home<br>and you’re looking forward to it like a loss or something<br>like that and you sit through the commercials<br>but it’s way better to not<br>do that it’s way better to do it whenever you want it<br>and to be able to control<br>it and fast forward it<br>and if you could download this as an mp three<br>that’s the shit you’re in the car<br>and you’re like all<br>these dumb motherfuckers are talking about mma again<br>leads fast forward five minutes so what he’s talking about<br>you know i mean you can do whatever you want with it<br>it’s yours you got it<br>you control what<br>you want to pause it<br>you can do that you don’t miss anything<br>you want to rewind it you can do that<br>how many times have you been listening to someone talk<br>on the radio and they say some cool<br>bitch but you don’t know what the fuck<br>they said you’re trying to write it down<br>you know everything in your car<br>you’re in traffic<br>how cool would it be to rewind the radio well<br>you can with this this is way superior<br>to just broadcasting shit plus<br>there’s not signals in the air that kill the bees<br>cassette tapes<br>for life yeah cassettes yo all right ladies and gentlemen<br>i think that’s about it yeah<br>i think we’re gonna end this<br>because brian’s tired and it’s already four forty<br>so this is two hours and forty minutes<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>so we gave you an extra ten minutes of actual fake radio<br>silence with bubbles and the whole deal you know i’m saying<br>all right do i get any inspiration let me answer this<br>though did you get a lot of inspiration from this from<br>your interaction<br>tom green<br>yet i don’t know i don’t know<br>this thing is moving so fastly<br>and his stuff this is foons<br>foons and spork<br>shit it’s moving so fast<br>it’s hard to follow chat<br>yes definitely<br>we did<br>i did tom greenshow once and it’s fucking awesome he’s got this<br>cool ass house<br>where his whole house is basically like<br>he’s turned into a studio he’s got this<br>killer setup where he’s got like servers in his house<br>i mean his house is really like the center of it all<br>it’s like we’re using u stream and u stream obviously has<br>you know some<br>servers set up somewhere<br>but we’re just kind of connected to them<br>and broadcasting to you<br>tom green’s got that shit all out of his house it’s just<br>really kind of a crazy expensive way to do it yeah well<br>it made sense<br>before all these<br>websites like eastern came around now it’s kind of like well<br>you don’t have to do it how is he doing<br>how’s tom marine showed doing people still watching it<br>i think it’s paper view now<br>or something like that i think it’s the paper view is<br>the footage the archives<br>and i think<br>it’s hard to figure out how to make money with this stuff<br>you know that’s what it is with these guys like tom green<br>trying to figure out how to make money with it<br>you know i think it’s kind of tricky he’s doing<br>comedy now he’s doing like stand up comedy tours<br>hmm<br>so yeah we got a lot of inspiration from all this stuff<br>there’s a lot of cool shit on the internet<br>you know the internet is where i spend a lot of my time<br>it’s where brian spends a lot of his time<br>and we think that this is the future<br>i mean i just got a thing for my car<br>yesterday i got a new car yesterday i got a m three bmw m three<br>it’s the shit<br>and i got a thing where i can hook up my ipod to it it’s awesome<br>so my playlist showed up in<br>the on screen the screen<br>and i could scroll through it and pick songs i want it’s so much<br>better than the radio<br>it’s awesome you know it’s just<br>you can control i mean you can have<br>so much shit there’s so many interesting things<br>you download books on<br>tape there’s so much shit that you can throw at an ipod<br>you know instead of like<br>scanning through the radio it’s like<br>i mean you don’t even get a guide<br>it’s like<br>it’s like watching the tv by just flipping the channels you<br>know you kind of know what’s going to be on<br>because you memorized it<br>do you have all these gay apples<br>all right ladies and gentlemen thank you very much<br>and we will see you next week<br>next week when i try to do it on<br>wednesday<br>and like i said we’re gonna have the shit up on itunes soon<br>thank you very much thank you</p></article><div class="post-copyright"><div class="post-copyright__author"><span class="post-copyright-meta">Author: </span><span
