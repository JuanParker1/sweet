fucking christ<br>i should have known i couldn’t hear myself christ<br>i should have known well<br>it’s a record down here so the replays will have it<br>the replays will have it<br>nobody wants to watch the replays god damn it<br>well let’s recap what a hilarious cluster fuck<br>we’re gonna<br>meet that meet the audio why am i meeting the audio because<br>you here oh<br>well let’s recap what we were talking about well<br>i’m very upset here<br>i just said some genius shit<br>probably the most profound shit i’ve ever said in my life<br>anyway what i said in the beginning the very beginning was that<br>i’m excited to do these<br>u stream broadcasts<br>and i’m excited that i decided to do it because<br>i like doing radio interviews and i like doing tv interviews<br>and that’s all fun<br>magazine stuff is fun<br>but it’s way cool to just be able to talk to people and answer<br>people’s questions directly<br>you know and it’s it’s easy to get<br>a weird impression of someone you know<br>seeing someone on television you know<br>television represents you to a certain extent you know<br>it’s like a lot of these guys<br>and the reality shows that get upset like television<br>doesn’t you know<br>it represents you in little snippets and cuts you up you know<br>but the best way to communicate with people<br>for sure is the internet and twitter and<br>u stream so combining the two of them together<br>what we’re doing is<br>we’re gonna do this every week<br>the thing behind me<br>while that’s bullshit behind me<br>that’s all gonna get cleared out<br>and we’re gonna put up a green screen<br>so we could have like space behind us and shit<br>and we’re gonna have this thing set up<br>at a little bit more natural angle<br>so you’re like looking right at us<br>which makes more sense right<br>yeah you<br>put it right there<br>is that better you say i pick right in the middle<br>yeah yeah<br>this motherfucker<br>this is the i got i upgraded my internet i had some old ass dsl<br>it was pretty whack<br>and i got rid of it today actually<br>totally had got it set up was this work now yeah<br>much better<br>so<br>the dsl is gone and now i got cable and cables fast as fuck so<br>we’re gonna be able to air videos and shit<br>while it’s going on<br>and<br>my mom designed my office purple shades bro it was wrong purple<br>it’s a beautiful color<br>you don’t like that color<br>it should be fucking<br>black dude with skulls like your fucking shirt bro<br>there’s nothing wrong with purple my friend<br>it’s a beautiful color<br>and there’s brian see brian in the corner there<br>brian is actually right next to me<br>but he’s getting facefuck by that advertisement<br>you’re gonna get facefuck you should move yourself up<br>hi i’m over here now can you move yourself up right next to me<br>there we go that’s better<br>because you’re not gonna get fucked by that uh<br>no don’t go all the way up there right<br>there no writing them out let go move over towards my head more<br>i could be this way right no this way that’s right hi<br>there we go perfect<br>that’s brian brian’s right next to me anyway<br>we’re just talking about the internet being an awesome<br>it’s the fucking coolest thing ever i mean<br>to be able to communicate with people<br>directly like this to be able to get the answers to any question<br>at any time to me<br>it’s the greatest fucking thing in the world i spend<br>most of my day<br>staring at a screen<br>reading stories<br>watching fucking youtube videos and<br>i swear i’ve learned more<br>from the internet<br>more from just being on message boards than i ever have<br>from you know<br>from other shit i’ve got into<br>all sorts of subjects because of message boards<br>you know and wound up you know<br>being fans of musicians and comedians and<br>people i would have never heard of it wasn’t for message boards<br>it’s like a whole online party i meet more people<br>online than i do in real life now it feels good<br>and i don’t just live in my house i go out a lot<br>but it’s just more people<br>interested in the same things i like to get to know<br>them better on the internet yeah well<br>the internet allows you<br>when someone posts for a long time like you watch especially<br>a message board community<br>you get to see how they interact with other people<br>you get to see what happens when you know<br>they’re challenged on their idea<br>as you get to see<br>you get to see what they’re made of you know it’s really<br>interesting yeah<br>you would the way people write is different<br>than the way they talk<br>because people can think they’re slick<br>and they could try to bullshit you by really<br>patiently scribing out their words but<br>they’re not tricking you eventually<br>eventually that shit just comes out because they don’t realize<br>how douchey they are<br>they don’t realize they think they’re not douchey<br>but in your writing<br>the douchey always comes out it’s like this is<br>your expression is almost like a prin out of you<br>it’s like<br>it’s like you know like your dna or something like that yeah<br>you know what i mean and plus<br>google helps too because then you catch a lot of people yeah<br>you know like it’s the best<br>it’s the best catch people<br>what are you talking about check out these photos yeah<br>people love to talk shit<br>people love to pretend that they know things<br>nobody wants to pretend that they’re fucking clueless<br>you know everybody wants to be the wizard<br>everybody wants to be the smartest man<br>in the world you know

that are crazy<br>and they really think they’re good<br>and they would love to have an opportunity to do something<br>like american idol for stand up they would get up there<br>and go fucking crazy

fun of the show right isn’t it yeah<br>i think so the little youtube clips that i would get like<br>people sent me one occasionally<br>like the one where<br>she said your first song it was really cool<br>but your second song i didn’t like<br>and they were like he only just sang one song<br>like she’s so fucking locked out of it well<br>you know why right<br>she was in a car accident right<br>and they’re like real supposedly if it’s like real pain right<br>oh well you know what happens man<br>that’s what happened to carl parisian too<br>you know kara priesian<br>got a real bad injury and took pain pills yeah<br>there the pain pills are a motherfucker<br>man<br>i know a lot of people that have had problems with pain pills<br>you know people with anything<br>it’s sort of a chronic problem where you have to take them<br>you know<br>those motherfuckers they’ll grab a hold you and it’s not just<br>you know the weak or you know people like<br>the people have a weird opinion of<br>people that get hooked on drugs<br>you know but i’ve met some carl parisians<br>you know i don’t know i don’t know i’m just saying<br>i shouldn’t say carl<br>because i don’t think carl has a problem<br>with him i think carl is<br>some sort of an anxiety disorder<br>but i know that he had to take him<br>and it’s hard once you take him to get rid of him<br>i know a bunch of dudes that need them<br>you know like people that have like any sort of a back injury<br>debilitating back injury<br>and that you get hooked<br>on those bitches and they get you through the day<br>i know a lot of people that just need that man<br>you know they need them<br>it’s just terrible and what i was saying is<br>the the dudes that<br>i know that have had problems with paint pills a lot of them<br>are like really<br>smart guys that went to college and they’re not idiots you know<br>why do you have that thing in front of my face<br>i’m moving it i’m just gonna show you this video on a second<br>well okay man but you can’t do that<br>all right it’s only been a second<br>i’ve seen this<br>i know i was gonna talk about it okay<br>but why do you have it in front of my fucking face<br>i like looking at myself<br>calm down<br>well nobody knows what the fuck you’re doing yeah<br>who cares it’s a fucking webcast dude this is serious business<br>i totally forgot what i was even talking about<br>what was i talking about<br>actually i was doing this you motherfucker<br>stupid bullshit<br>tell me<br>ladies and gentlemen what the fuck was i just talking about huh<br>pretty crazy about that dog though and i hurt<br>that video huh<br>the dog in the video that yeah<br>there was a dog that<br>knew about the earthquake before the people do<br>that’s because people here shit they don’t pay attention<br>the dog heard something he’s probably what the fuck<br>and the person was like what<br>the fuck is that shit he didn’t react and then it had<br>because it was only like a second before it<br>there’s that video right here watch the dog it just freaked out<br>and ran i mean but it was a while before it even anything shook<br>all right let’s see it again rewind it here’s the dog<br>dogs chilling dogs okay what the fuck is that noise<br>okay we don’t know that that dude didn’t react<br>this is a stupid video no no<br>no but this is the problem the dog took off running<br>but the guy you don’t see his face the guy might have went oh<br>shit what the fuck<br>and everybody is making it like the dog<br>heard this before anybody else i think he felt something<br>because if you look at it<br>but nothing’s moving at all<br>right but sometimes you hear things before the earthquake well<br>you know that’s true<br>you know it doesn’t really start move until<br>let me see you again<br>yeah you’re right you’re right and shit moving<br>maybe it made a sound yeah<br>you’re right nothing’s moving around too though it’s kind of<br>if there was a sound<br>right a real rumble you’d still see something<br>monitor so the dogs like two seconds more than a person<br>but guess what we got thumbs faggot<br>go chase you down tail and sleep in dirt<br>all right what else were we talking about folks<br>we were talking about some important shit and<br>i forgot about it<br>god damn we got a lot of twitter must just coming in this bitch<br>that mark mcguire thing that thing is hilarious<br>marc maguar is finally coming out and saying<br>that’s what we were talking about<br>we’re talking about people that are hooked on pain pills right<br>you know that it’s<br>when dudes get hooked on pain pills like i said<br>i know a guy who’s a very smart guy he was an it guy<br>went to you know<br>went to college<br>really avid reader not a fuck up has a real problem<br>and that’s just what it is man<br>dudes dudes get injured something happens to you and<br>it just it chemically bonds with your body i mean<br>it’s really incredible<br>what a diction is<br>you know addiction is<br>your body is somehow another linked to something<br>that’s really terrible for it<br>and it needs that something like it becomes<br>it’s almost like like heroin<br>and and crystal math and stuff like that that really<br>locks a hold of your body<br>it’s almost like their parasites it’s almost like<br>the drug itself has a consciousness<br>and the drug itself is going to<br>make you do it as much as you can and rob you of life<br>you know<br>i mean that’s one way to look at like horrible substances<br>that’s why when people talk about drugs<br>you know and they like to lump all drugs in together<br>that’s so stupid<br>because marijuana and mushrooms and<br>psychedelic drugs if done correctly can be very beneficial and<br>when they’re over<br>you don’t feel any repercussions you’re okay<br>they don’t hurt you<br>marijuana and<br>mushrooms and things like that the natural things<br>that people have been doing for tens of thousands of years<br>those things aren’t hurting anybody man<br>and they can’t get into your system<br>you know and if you lump them in with<br>oxycodones and fucking heroin and crystal meth<br>that’s ridiculous no<br>one is becoming a more introspective fascinating person<br>on crystal meth<br>they’re becoming fucking crazy it’s like<br>we have to like look at drugs<br>in terms of what they do to the people that take them and<br>the things that do positive things you can’t ignore that<br>just because they’re a drug you’re not allowed to just say oh<br>because it’s an illegal drug<br>then all the benefits that people talk about<br>are those don’t count they’re invalid<br>just because it’s not<br>sanctioned by a group of fucking criminals<br>that’s ridiculous it doesn’t make any sense at all<br>and you know i’ve lived my whole life like this<br>i mean it’s two thousand and ten i would have thought by now<br>we would have come to some sort of irrational<br>understanding as human beings<br>as we got to be adults i thought we would come to a point<br>where we would sit back<br>and we would look at things to go who would what right<br>do i to tell another person<br>what to<br>do or not to do as long as he’s not trying to give it to miners<br>or people that don’t know any better<br>as long as people are educated let’s spend money on programs<br>and make sure that people<br>don’t get involved in anything<br>fucked up like this<br>and let’s pay attention to fucking children<br>schools i mean the biggest problem<br>this country isn’t laws<br>and crime the biggest problem is why are people creating crime<br>why are people doing these terrible things to each other<br>in the ninety nine point<br>nine nine percent of all<br>fucked up things become out of a fucked up childhood<br>you have kids who have<br>shitty fucking parents and<br>these fucking children they grow up<br>and they’re ticking time bombs<br>if you have a douchebag fucked up drug<br>addict parent and you live in a fucked up place with no love<br>and every day you just see violence and shit and screaming and<br>addiction and sorrow and there’s no way out you don’t see shit<br>you don’t do well in school mean what the fuck you know<br>that is a ticking time bomb<br>and for politicians to not address that<br>and to spend all this fucking time flying over to afghanistan<br>trying to chase down a hundred<br>taliban fighters and the mountains and<br>young people are dying over there for that<br>how about<br>we spend that money attacking the fucking enemy at home<br>the enemy at home is<br>horrible fucking childhoods that some of<br>our fellow human beings in this country have to go through<br>you know what we really need to do is focus on fucking kids<br>focus on children that are growing up in terrible neighborhoods<br>focus on fucking schools and community centers<br>and given these<br>kids somewhere to go to when their parents suck<br>you know<br>focus on a bunch of people that want to help raise kids that<br>come from terrible situations or help the parents<br>understand what the fuck they’re doing raising children and<br>making these kids fucking cycles and giving them horrible<br>childhoods you know<br>and<br>literally setting loose a bomb<br>setting moves someone who’s eventually gonna turn<br>all their inward anger outward another people<br>all their pain and resentment and all<br>the negative input coming into them as a child<br>you know that shit is fucking terrible<br>you deal with a child that comes from a positive<br>loving environment<br>and you’re gonna deal with a cool human being<br>that human being’s gonna come out of that<br>and you’re gonna appreciate other people<br>that’s our number one problem<br>is human beings our number<br>one problem is human beings is the way we don’t<br>appreciate each other<br>the way we look at each other is competition<br>the way we look at each other<br>is just people that are on the highway in my fucking way<br>human beings have to learn to appreciate each other<br>and we need to learn<br>how to deal with the fucking very obvious ship that<br>we ignore<br>instead of pretending there’s some incredible assault on<br>the human race here in america you know maybe we should look on<br>where this is the real crime coming from<br>where are the real murders coming from<br>where is the real<br>anger and violence from the ship that affects day to day people<br>every day it’s not the fucking desert okay<br>it’s not the fucking mountains of afghanistan it’s in cities<br>it’s all over the place<br>it’s children growing up and becoming fucking criminals<br>that’s way scarier to me<br>than some douchebag in afghanistan<br>you know it’s nonsense<br>yeah someone said carl and pills yeah<br>that’s something carl’s training partner said<br>but like i said i don’t know if it’s true<br>all i know is that<br>he’s always been a cool dude to me<br>carl praising he’s a great fighter<br>and he’s got some<br>unfortunate situations<br>and i hope he works him out i like that dude<br>i like that dude a lot<br>he’s good people<br>and he’s a bad motherfucker one of the<br>best judo guys to ever enter mma you know<br>he opened people’s eyes to a lot of shit that was possible<br>because before karo<br>nobody was hitting like those<br>beautiful fucking throws<br>he hits these beautiful shoulder throws and hip throws and<br>his judo like back when he fought like dave strasser<br>like one of his first<br>ufc bounce incredible judo you know and it’s that’s<br>whenever you get a guy who steps into mma<br>and has some totally something<br>that he’s really really good at that most people aren’t like<br>like machida with karate<br>like people thought well<br>karate’s not that good karate doesn’t really work<br>until machida came along and machida so good at karate<br>that he makes karate work in mma you know<br>obviously he knows wrestling and obviously<br>he knows all the other stuff that goes with mma<br>which is why he’s such a champion<br>but the bottom line is his karate<br>his ability to move backward<br>i mean he fights like a fucking john club<br>vendan movie and it’s pretty badass to watch<br>you know because until the showgun fight he really didn’t take<br>hardly any damage<br>what do i think about the united arab emirates buying it to zufa<br>well<br>i know that the guy who is behind it all is sheep talk noon of<br>abu dhabi and that guy is a huge fan of mixed martial arts<br>and he’s incredibly incredibly wealthy so<br>you know that guy<br>he can do a lot of good things for mma that guy<br>he is a brazilian jujitsu black belt<br>under henzo gracie<br>and by all accounts he’s legit<br>by all accounts he’s a really good black belt<br>and henzo is one of the most respected instructors in the world<br>if henzo gracie gives you a black belt that’s a huge honor<br>so that chic tac noon<br>the fact that he’s a henzo gracie black belt<br>i know he’s been having people<br>travel to abu dhabi for years for over a decade<br>since the late nineties<br>and he had like some of the best instructors in the world<br>that would come and stay with him<br>and he had a whole camp there and he bring guys<br>and have guys to train with<br>mean he just dude is just the jujutsu fiend just i mean like<br>more than the way<br>more than me you know<br>like i mean think about how much i love jujutsu<br>and this guy is like<br>you know he’s just like he loves it<br>and he has unlimited resources<br>so having a guy like that<br>as a business partner in the ufc<br>i think it’s gonna be<br>phenomenal for the sport i don’t think there’s any question<br>that guy’s gonna<br>without a doubt that guy’s gonna help out<br>it’s gonna be interesting to go there<br>that dude lives in a castle<br>like a fucking<br>some old school<br>you know ali baba type shit right<br>yeah is he the one with all the paintings<br>no who is the guy that i don’t know<br>the sheik has like<br>i think that that royal family is worth like<br>some insane amount of money<br>like they’re one of the most<br>the richest people in the world<br>how about that if one of the richest people the world<br>then dude is a fucking<br>train killer<br>do i think<br>talk doing is gonna take an active role like dana white<br>i have no idea<br>all i do for the ufc is the commentary you know<br>i mean i talk to those guys and they’re my friends but<br>obviously i have no<br>no influence what’s over on the business side of things<br>it’s just my job to<br>call the action it’s a really pretty fucking<br>crazy gig you know<br>you know for me it’s like a perfect job because i’m a<br>huge fan of mixed martial arts like for real like i don’t want<br>i don’t watch<br>like when i watched the the different shows like k one or<br>sent goku or<br>you know dream or or strike force or anything like that<br>when i watch those shows i don’t watch those shows for work<br>i don’t i don’t you know i don’t get on the underground on<br>mix martial arts com<br>or you know<br>read all the bloody elbow read all these different websites and<br>do it just for<br>fun i would have done it even if i would have done it<br>even if it wasn’t my job<br>i’m just a huge fan like professionally and i’m very lucky<br>you know it’s pretty crazy gig man<br>it’s a lot of fun<br>it’s cool too because<br>we get to go to the fights and you know be there live<br>and be right in front of the cage<br>i mean it’s just like there’s nothing like that<br>what do you think at the last ufc<br>so good fights man did you see it yeah that evan dunham<br>dude how badass is that guy yeah<br>and he got tagged in the first round<br>the first round you know frame was all over him<br>and then ever done him survived and pulled off<br>that that fucking<br>arm bar was so bad ass<br>the way he did it was like it was so<br>wicked did he break his arm at all<br>no he did not break his arm he fucked up his tendons so<br>lucky for him you know<br>it was a the problem<br>is man if it break if that the way that arm bar happened<br>see how his arm like he was bending it completely at the joint<br>the scary con is the way frank mirb broke<br>tim sylvia’s arm<br>because he actually<br>broke the middle of the forearm he broke the forearm in half<br>that’s the scary shit that takes forever to heal<br>and it’s usually not the same<br>now like i don’t think<br>you know i think you break your arm like that man like<br>that’s a serious<br>fucking fracture<br>like in the middle i think if you bust up a joint<br>they could put that together<br>a little bit easier<br>can’t they be fake arms in now by now<br>you like metal arms or bones or something<br>i don’t think they can i think they do hips<br>and they do knees but once you get a knee<br>that’s a wrap you ain’t doing no jijitsu<br>well this is due name connor connor hewn<br>he’s one of eddie’s top students real high level wrestler<br>and his dad was a wrestler and his dad got a hip replacement<br>and his dad<br>still does dujitsu and fights in tournaments and the dudes like<br>fifty it’s incredible<br>you know but he has a hip replacement<br>but he’s a fucking psycho and he’s a stud<br>you know the average person<br>you get a hip replacement and that’s a wrap you know<br>remember that dude from the sopranos he used to walk fucked up<br>the fat guy who turned out you know<br>he’s gay and the sopranos and he had that weird walk<br>do you remember that guy<br>what was his name<br>i don’t remember that guy’s character how did he die<br>i can’t remember<br>so they killed him<br>remember he was gay right<br>how how did it go<br>they murdered him i think they chumped like a fucking<br>broomstick up his ass or a pond reps member pool cue<br>a pool cue up his ass yeah<br>that’s right because he was selling a line of pool cues<br>after that the dude tried to sell a line of pool cues<br>a q to die for<br>was like the bottom brake it was like a brake stick<br>that’s ridiculous but soprano’s told him to knock it off<br>how hilarious is that as a dude it’s a marketing sense<br>i got killed with a pool cue<br>i’ll show down those motherfuckers and they sell pool cues<br>sells pool cues<br>because they killed them with one of the sopranos<br>the greatest show of all time right<br>yeah oh i miss it<br>even though<br>it got slow near the end but i still missed you know<br>i got into battlestar galactica for a while<br>i liked that up until the last season<br>but the last season i just didn’t give a shit about<br>lost is the only thing that really got me<br>like this season i’m still<br>really pumped up to see what the fuck is going on<br>because i watched lost<br>i didn’t watch it at all for like the first whatever seasons<br>there were the first<br>three or four seasons whatever<br>it is how many seasons have they done uh seven<br>have they really<br>well i watched all of them from the beginning to the end<br>all of them on dvd<br>which is the shit<br>if you’ve managed to avoid like ari did that with the sopranos<br>he didn’t leave his fucking house<br>ari stayed home for like weeks<br>and just watched the soprano’s dvds watch the whole series<br>to the end have you ever done that no only with<br>lost but i caught up to the ones that were on the dvr last year<br>it did like the first three seasons the sopranos that way<br>oh yeah two seasons of loss<br>dexter i did that way too whole first season so wait but<br>dexter is another one<br>last year i was like yeah<br>this year rather as soon as i started watching i was like<br>i’m not in this anymore<br>or some dude killing people<br>yeah after a while i’m like okay<br>where were we gonna go with this<br>you know you’re gonna keep getting away with this<br>i’m gonna keep seeing you kill the bad guy every week really<br>come on man this is silly did you see that brake dancing robot<br>yes i did how awesome was that how about that fuck robot<br>that they created yeah<br>did you see that yeah<br>that’s gross did you see jimmy cameron last night no<br>i didn’t see it<br>he was dressed up as jade langley i heard it was hilarious oh<br>it was talking about the stern oh<br>funny here i’ll show you right now<br>oh we’re gonna see this jimmy kimmel dressed up as<br>j lana the fucking wars the war<br>the war for late night listen fuck late night<br>the internet is where it’s at ladies and gentlemen<br>this is the real connection to human beings these<br>silly shows where you sit down and<br>you know ask some fucking sixteen year old kid<br>what our new cd is<br>you know hey<br>so i understand you got a new show out<br>oh that’s terrific<br>who gives a fuck about all that stuff it’s just<br>you’re just on there<br>there’s just people on their pimpin things<br>people pimp in movies and occasionally<br>someone gives their dick sucked by some crazy cook<br>or something like the hugrant interview<br>and to get an interesting<br>interview or the other dude<br>that the<br>what’s his name waki and phoenix<br>that showed up all fucked up<br>what happened to him is he still fucking crazy i don’t know<br>but letterman is the best for<br>taking advantage of those situations yeah<br>waki and phoenix either was playing a character<br>he might have been just doing it for a goof<br>you know i could see him doing something<br>some people are saying it’s real<br>there’s just gone just he’s completely gone<br>it’s not hard to do if you’re<br>a person who wanted to be famous<br>and you know your whole life you’ve wanted to be famous and<br>you have this need<br>this hyper need for attention<br>and then all of a sudden that happens to you<br>like holy shit<br>you

know<br>people come up to you for fear factor like what the fuck dude<br>and i was like yeah i know<br>what the fuck but it’s not like they love<br>you know like if you’re<br>an actor or something like that and you’re in some<br>crazy movies like that guy is the kind of adulation<br>that guy must get is insane<br>you know and if it was already crazy to begin with that just<br>when crazy people<br>all of a sudden have money and<br>people kiss in their ass<br>you know crazy people are supposed to be like suppressed<br>like you split the crazy people<br>you’re supposed to see them and go hey<br>fuckhead you’re crazy<br>but that doesn’t work<br>like on the tv show or a movie because once you become crazy<br>it doesn’t matter if you’re a star<br>they let you be crazy so you’re just fucking hog wild and<br>doing blow and punching people<br>and<br>they try to protect you as much as possible because you’re the<br>goose that lays<br>the golden egg<br>and that’s what happens to a lot of actors<br>that’s why they get fucking nutty<br>so what is this video here<br>wait jay leno okay<br>this is jimmy kimmel<br>from last night<br>i guess he was making fun of jay leno<br>dude natalie

companies that dropped them<br>and one of the posters is tiger looking like you know<br>contemplating a shot<br>and it says something like it’s what you do next that counts<br>i put it up on my twitter page and like man<br>how fucking telling is that<br>did he ever have a fucking inkling of a clue<br>that that’s what was gonna happen when he put that picture out<br>and people like people freak out about the tiger woods<br>thing like that he’s a terrible person he said<br>yes it’s not the best thing to do i agree but that guy is an un<br>handsome<br>he’s an unfortunate looking guy he’s very unfortunate looking<br>and he’s a fucking billionaire<br>he’s like got super super rich dude<br>i bet it was impossible for him to say no to all those chicks<br>you know i mean if you think i mean<br>obviously he was a pussy hound<br>i mean there’s no getting away from that<br>but to be like that guy<br>you know and have all these tens<br>and they’re chasing you down<br>and they don’t even care if you’re married<br>and they’ll fly to other countries to hang out with you<br>holy shit you know<br>it’s like a rockstar<br>he’s totally like a rockstar<br>and it was like yeah well<br>then you shouldn’t be married i<br>totally agree i’m not defending him in any way<br>he’s more of a rockstar<br>most rockstars don’t have their own beverage<br>they don’t have their own clothing line<br>that dude’s fucking crazy yeah<br>people love that stupid ass game<br>they love it the especially business people if you want to<br>get down with business you know<br>i’ve heard a lot of people<br>say that if you<br>want<br>to be successful in business that you literally have to learn<br>golf<br>like you literally have to learn it if you don’t learn golf<br>they hit refers on the screen eyes<br>show you experience so you can see what’s there<br>what’s going on<br>it’s<br>just the picture that picture you’re talking about tire lids<br>what’s wrong with this thing<br>i don’t know<br>you stream you’re<br>sucking it i would dummies<br>i would close your firefox and open up like in safari or what<br>chrome maybe have two and shit open no<br>there it goes i’d see there it goes the picture is up finally<br>see that’s much than much of a delay so like<br>i said if you see a werewolf behind me and you hear that<br>believe me i’m already dead okay<br>just be kind to be on the message boards<br>people were brutal about artie langman<br>that was really sad to see<br>how many people were brutal after<br>artie lang tried to commit suicide like calling them<br>people don’t like that suicide shit right<br>i know but it wasn’t just that<br>it was<br>it was they were they were insulting him like it didn’t matter<br>you know you know like that he’s weak and he’s a piece of shit<br>like i said about where i talked about<br>the people that i know that have<br>had problems with paint pills it’s not like<br>you know the guy likes to jerk off<br>he jerks off<br>too much like that guy you need to smack him in the hag<br>what the fuck is wrong with you<br>you lost your job because you jerk off five times a day<br>you know there’s dudes like that<br>they’re like they miss jobs<br>they show up late for work<br>just because they’re like chronic master bears they wake up<br>the morning they have to beat off<br>they don’t beat off they’re gonna go crazy<br>like they get that’s a dude that’s got a problem that guy’s<br>he needs a smack in the head people that are like<br>like compulsive gamblers that’s a compulsion and that’s like<br>there’s a problem<br>and your pattern of thinking there’s a problem in the way<br>you know and i’ve been<br>compulsive about many things in my life i understand what<br>i understand of thinking behind it<br>but that<br>can all be corrected you just need to learn how to think<br>correctly<br>there’s a big difference between that and like heroin and<br>oxycontin and math and<br>people who get addicted to shit that shit’s real<br>that’s real you know so<br>to get<br>to shit all over someone because they’re addicted to a drug<br>man it ain’t easy to kick that you don’t you know<br>unless you’re doing it<br>unless you’re deep in the throes of heroin you can’t talk shit<br>and if you have been and i haven’t so i can say nothing but<br>i’ve talked to people who have<br>i had a friend who died from heroin<br>i knew a couple people that died from heroin and<br>the one that i knew he<br>was a real real smart guy he was a cool dude<br>he just couldn’t stop it<br>i don’t you know i don’t i think some people bond to those<br>dangerous drugs and you’re fucked<br>so<br>whatever happened with him artie lang was<br>every time i met that guy he’s always been cool to me<br>and that’s that’s how i judge people<br>he’s always fun to be around friendly<br>jovial<br>i think he’s hilarious<br>he’s just he’s a nice guy you know and to me it just made me sad<br>and maybe just a sound that people were<br>willing to shit on this guy because he tried to kill himself<br>but you are right<br>people get mad when people try to kill themselves<br>you know<br>especially when people have a much better life than them<br>yeah you know<br>i mean that was<br>the argument that i heard over and over again about already<br>like this fucking guy<br>you know what are his problems<br>he’s got a mercedes and you know he’s rich and<br>all true but that doesn’t make you feel better unfortunately<br>you think it would<br>but it doesn’t if your life sucked<br>your life sucks<br>and it really has nothing to do with you being rich or poor<br>rich can definitely help things because you don’t have to worry<br>about your bills<br>and you have less problems you have a little bit less dress<br>but then you got<br>problems with your money and investments and people<br>stealing from you and bullshit you know<br>you have problems all over the place<br>definitely better to have it than or not<br>but the bottom line is just because they’re successful<br>doesn’t mean you’re happy<br>there’s a lot of people that are fucking hardly<br>hardly depressed and they sit around thinking well<br>what the fuck is the purpose of this life<br>you know and the real problem is<br>that’s a good goddamn question what is the purpose of this life<br>if you’re not here for other people<br>what are you here for<br>because realistically<br>you get to a certain point your life like already and i are<br>basically the same age<br>i’m forty two and i believe he is too<br>and you get to a point where you<br>get all this gray like i have gray hair on my<br>beard and on my balls i have like twenty gray hair so<br>gray hair is coming in here<br>i mean this is like you know your body’s dying<br>so at a certain point time you gotta go<br>what the fuck is the purpose of all this<br>what am i dear for<br>you know and if you don’t have like a relationship<br>you don’t have someone you love<br>you don’t have really good friends that you love<br>and you love to be around you don’t<br>have a family you don’t have children<br>don’t have someone that<br>that you mean something too and someone that you<br>you feed off of each other<br>and you share energy and you make them feel good<br>and they make you feel good no<br>they miss you and you miss them and that’s very<br>very very very important for people<br>and people just underestimate how huge that is you know having<br>friends and having<br>family and having like good quality people in your life<br>and<br>not douchebags cut the douchebags out that is so important<br>because nothing can fuck your life up more than people who<br>are not looking out for your best interests and want you to fail<br>because they’re fucked up you know<br>try to let them aware of it<br>let them be aware of it<br>give them an opportunity to change and if they don’t<br>get rid of them<br>caught them out of your life<br>so important just<br>separate yourself from anybody negative<br>that’s going to fuck with you<br>that can make<br>such a huge difference in the quality of your life<br>you know and then of course<br>get the fuck away from drugs the bad ones<br>don’t fuck around with heroin<br>don’t fuck around with math don’t fuck around with anything<br>dangerous if you’re gonna do something<br>do things that people have never died from<br>and make sure you know what the fuck you’re doing before<br>you do it you know don’t go crazy and smoke the whole joint<br>the first time<br>you know<br>you’ll shit your pants in paranoia you freak the fuck out<br>you’re probably never gonna get high again<br>the first time you ever get high you should just get a little<br>tiny bit high<br>just a little<br>take a tiny bit of a hit and get used to it you know god<br>it’s like riding a surfboard<br>you can’t just hop on you’ll be awesome on it<br>you know the feeling of being caught up in the wave of tac<br>when when you get<br>really high it’s like you’re connecting to like another<br>another frequency that<br>it’s not available to you when you’re sober<br>and that’s what people don’t smoke marijuana don’t understand<br>there’s an awareness an opening<br>of your mind man i’ve had to explain to me<br>chemically about you know<br>gaba and dopamine and all the different things<br>that go on<br>so there was a recent thread about it on my message board<br>where people are talking about the effect of it<br>but the bottom on is it does something to the way you think<br>and it opens up new levels of awareness<br>and if you get too much of that<br>you’re going to freak the fuck out<br>and that’s called being paranoid<br>but what paranoia comes from is this is probably the first time<br>you’re recognizing reality<br>you know you’re a very vulnerable person we all are life is<br>you know it’s a transient experience it’s<br>going to pass from this to something else maybe who knows<br>who knows what the fuck this is the first place<br>who knows<br>what the ultimate goal of the human racist in the first place<br>you just live your life and go through it and<br>you put your blinders on and when you have a hit of some<br>really good weed<br>those blinders just fall down around you<br>and you realize like wow<br>i’m this fragile fleshy little temporary being<br>that’s pleaking to this spinning orb<br>as it’s flying through the galaxy<br>and people are sitting around talking about john and cayde and<br>fucking miley cyrus and nonsense<br>and while this is all going on we’re hurling through the galaxy<br>and it literally is never discussed you know<br>and i have a bit about it you can see it on youtube<br>i think it’s somebody put it up it’s from my<br>shiny happy g hot cd<br>it’s about flying through space but that’s what we are and<br>we’re just animals clinging to a spear in eternity<br>in this gigantic sea<br>of eternity sea of space this<br>never ending thing that we’re a part of but we completely<br>ignore and we focus on the most mundane bullshit<br>like tiger woods fucking all these girdles<br>you know and like what else what are the other<br>dumb shit that people have been focusing on lately in the news<br>i don’t know but i think<br>why people focus on so much of it because<br>you know they need<br>something<br>it’s like kind of watching the same movie over and over again<br>you know you need constant new information<br>and stuff like that you know like<br>i understand what you’re saying like<br>about the whole thing<br>but i think that’s why so<br>many people focus on the dumb shit because<br>the the<br>it’s new shit you know that same thing you think that yeah<br>that’s a good point so like what you’re saying is that<br>the reason why people focus on like tiger woods and stuff like<br>that is just because it’s new information it doesn’t matter<br>we’ve been in space for so long and nothing happens<br>and you look up you see stars blah blah blah shut the fuck up<br>right it’s like if having the same cell phone<br>would you have the same cell phone for ten years or<br>if tiger wood cell phone came out<br>would you get the tiger woods new cell phone that’s a good point<br>i think brian’s on something<br>i think you know it makes sense because you know<br>people are we do really we have this<br>push for new things and innovation<br>and it’s literally built into a hard wiring right<br>which is why<br>you can take a guy with the hottest chick in the world<br>and he doesn’t want to fuck her anymore<br>like you get tired of fucking the hottest chick in the world<br>and that really is true<br>you know that can happen yeah if you look at life the wrong way<br>and that’s one of the other things that’s awesome about weed<br>if you smoke weed and you fuck your girlfriend like<br>if you don’t usually do that<br>it’s like you’re fucking a new person<br>it’s like you appreciate her all<br>for like who she is and what she<br>what she looks like you appreciate it all over<br>again it’s really weird man at least for me<br>do you feel like that when you smoke weed and<br>get with your lady yeah<br>hmm won’t you smoke weedy to get with your lady<br>my lady doesn’t really smoke weed<br>so it’s not really that fun well mine can’t right now<br>because she’s pregnant with me bumbino<br>so have you applied with the nexus one yet<br>no i have not<br>you’re not a fan huh<br>not really<br>brian michael tech review ladies and gentlemen the main problem<br>is is if you have something like<br>we both have iphones and you have facebook<br>and twitter and all these applications right<br>i’ve had droid why have an inferior version what’s up yeah<br>all is<br>the facebook on the droid sucks the twitter on the droids<br>not as good as twitter too<br>you know everything is just<br>yeah i have the blackberry and i have uber twitter on it<br>i use i have an iphone but i really use it more of as like a<br>like a laptop that i keep in my pocket<br>that’s really what it is for me because<br>the bottom line with the iphone is it’s on at amp t and at amp t<br>sucks<br>when i’m talking to people on at amp t<br>i can guarantee it’s going to cut out<br>three or four times before<br>i get wherever the fuck i’m going<br>when i the driving my car<br>i love the fact that i can have<br>both hands on a steering wheel and i can just talk<br>you know and i’m having conversations and i can<br>you know do business and answer questions and<br>catch up with old friends<br>that i don’t have a chance to catch up with<br>i love that man that’s huge to me to me<br>that’s one of the most important features of communication<br>the ability to fucking talk to somebody<br>i don’t like text messaging just back and forth after a while<br>man you’re like<br>i wanted to hear your fucking voice you know<br>that’s the way i like talking to people you know it’s fun<br>you know you can get things out you feed off of each other<br>you know it’s a volley you’re going back and forth<br>so if your fucking phone<br>can’t make phone calls that’s weak yeah<br>that’s weak shit so i use a blackberry with verizon<br>no one’s paying me to say this<br>but the reason why i use the blackberry<br>it’s because<br>we do ufc’s in the uk and the only way you could get<br>a phone that works overseas you got to get a world phone<br>because we have two different systems here in america<br>we have cdma and<br>gsm and gsm is t mobile and at amp t<br>and cdma is sprint and varizon<br>and there are two totally different types of signals well<br>in other countries<br>most other countries don’t use the cdma which varizon has<br>but it’s the best in america in america<br>it’s the shit it’s way better i mean<br>when i drive to jujitsu<br>i would lose people three times of my at amp t phone<br>three fucking times would drive me crazy<br>but in my verizon<br>right there and it never drops off for a second<br>it’s so much better<br>but the bottom line is this shit is whack<br>this phone is like<br>an iphone from twenty fucking years ago that’s what it’s like<br>it’s like some some cheap<br>knock off you know like some third world country<br>you know where they make fake<br>watches and shit like<br>that they try to knock the cameras are pretty nice<br>the flashes are pretty nice yes<br>yes the cameras dope<br>the flash is very good<br>the video is excellent yes<br>ready texting the video is excellent it’s not bad to type on<br>the typing this is the new one the storm to<br>the double clicking is not bad<br>it’s not when i drop in the toilet yeah<br>it’s dropping the toilet<br>this was right next to my poo let us just<br>totally i was at the nine thirty club in washington dc<br>by the way i had a good fucking time down there<br>dc people thank you very much for your hospitality<br>awesome show i had a great time but anyway i was at the nine<br>thirty club this friday night<br>and i was pulling<br>my pre performance poo poo<br>and<br>i got up and this phone because i always called a piece of shit<br>committed suicide<br>and dove from my pocket into the shitty toilet it’s like<br>i’ll show you who a piece of shit is<br>tried to kill data i know what it’s doing<br>because it knows that i haven’t backed up in a couple of weeks<br>i was trying to i got some cool pictures and videos on here<br>and this motherfucker is trying to kill himself<br>and so i got it out<br>and shook it and shook all the water out but<br>i dried it with a hair dryer and the bitch came back<br>i mean it’s<br>it’s great it’s works quite<br>tired listen to your shit<br>joe rogan it’s terrible<br>for anything else when you try to go on the internet<br>you want to shoot yourself<br>you try to use the twitter function on here it’s so<br>clunky and whack and typing is<br>much it’s okay to type like text<br>but when you have to type in numbers<br>you have to like really<br>concentrate this little tiny ass keyboard where the numbers are<br>and you’re always<br>fucking up like when i have to give someone<br>if i’m like answering an email and i have to<br>give someone address or a phone number<br>it takes five fucking minutes because i<br>barely can push down the three i’m also<br>i’m always getting the number right next to it<br>it’s really weak and annoying<br>so that the iphone is the shit it’s just<br>so goddamn far above<br>every other phone out there<br>it’s not even close if you’re thinking about you want one phone<br>if you only had to choose between one phone<br>you got to go with the iphone<br>but if you can afford to have two phones<br>the iphone is great for like a little computer to me it’s huge<br>for pictures and twitters and applications and going on i would<br>probably wait<br>until after the<br>apple announcement in two weeks though<br>yes in case<br>there’s a varizon iphone if there’s a varizon iphone<br>i’ll fucking jump for joy<br>but i don’t think there’s gonna be one<br>we think that the varizon thing<br>we’ve read online because we’re both brian and i have all tech<br>retards the late verizon thing is<br>probably going to be some sort of a tablet like a little<br>like an internet like a kindle<br>but you can get on the internet with it<br>which would be kind of interesting<br>like a like a netbook with no keyboard<br>or just an oversized iphone pretty much<br>have i heard or upgrade the gray yeah<br>he’s that guy he’s a guy from england that is<br>a professor and a scientist he’s working hard on life extension<br>he’s an interesting dude kind of a<br>kind of a real eccentric character with crazy long beard and<br>you know he’s<br>got all these<br>really complex theories on how to extend the human lifetimes<br>like a thousand years<br>like the only way you would die is if you had you know<br>got an accident or something or sickness pretty fascinating shit<br>the problem is if people live forever<br>there’s not enough room for everybody<br>you know we’re trying to fuck with nature<br>you know nature has us in a cycle<br>and the cycle is very simple<br>nobody lives more<br>than like a hundred and twenty years if you’re the baddest<br>motherfucker ever<br>you live to be a buck<br>twenty and then you’re done<br>and the last<br>few years you are a fragile mess and you better not go anywhere<br>you know you could tie your shoes and break your back in half<br>you know you could fall down<br>you know when you’re going to wipe your ass and<br>head plant into the wall and be done<br>crack your neck paralyze<br>shell over the floor<br>i mean that could be the end<br>it’s gonna be ugly you know you’re gonna be<br>a human roll a tissue paper that’s what you’re gonna be so<br>that’s the cycle of life<br>you know and you have children and those children<br>you pass on your information<br>and that’s what’s supposed to happen<br>we are in the active process of evolving<br>as a species and<br>there’s two things that are going to aid that involvement<br>or evolvement rather<br>that evolution it’s going to be either technology<br>or it’s going to be what we learn and what we pass on<br>and if you don’t<br>evolve and if you don’t pass on something<br>if your children don’t evolve<br>this race can’t exist<br>from just the people that are alive now<br>living forever<br>because people don’t change that much<br>they try they do their best<br>but the amount of people that change<br>over the amount of people that don’t change<br>i mean shit how many people do you know<br>that get their shit together<br>that have gotten their shit together they didn’t have it<br>you know how many people do you know<br>mmm not many not that many<br>most people who are a fucking mass stay amass<br>and that’s not good<br>those aren’t good odds for a whole race of humans<br>you know i think that the best<br>bet for the human race and we really care about it as old<br>but we don’t we care about ourselves because we’re animals<br>and because we have these instincts<br>and these instincts are designed to make sure that we stay<br>alive and you know and that’s just hard wiring even though<br>your logic and your reason would dictate well hey<br>i’m only here for a temporary amount of time anyway<br>i need to look at this<br>like what is my purpose here what am i supposed to be doing<br>and what you’re supposed to be doing<br>is making it better for the next people<br>what you’re supposed to be doing<br>is making it as good as you can for the people here<br>and leaving an impression<br>so that maybe you can enhance the minds and open the eyes and<br>set the tone for the next people<br>you know if you meet a guy who’s like oh<br>i mean every time i never met someone who’s like really<br>fucking cool and really nice<br>and really friendly<br>it has always inspired me<br>to be cooler and nicer and friendlier it’s like it’s so<br>cool to meet people like that<br>but you know when i was growing up in boston<br>i knew a lot of fucking<br>hard ass people i knew a lot of people that were just<br>always ready to insult you and always wanted to fight and<br>i know a lot of<br>and if you grow up around a lot of people like that<br>you you become like that<br>like it can make you like that<br>you live in that environment where everybody’s kind of douche<br>each other on occasion<br>you know like you go out to a bar and boston<br>your chances are you’re gonna see a fight<br>you go to a night club in boston dudes still throw down<br>i mean it’s one of the few places like<br>remember when we went to we still do the the<br>comedy connection in fanuel hall<br>and after the show like two o’clock in the morning<br>that fucking place would be alive<br>in the summertime it was crackling it was crackling<br>like at any moment<br>you could see<br>a fucking brawl breakout where dudes punch somebody and<br>fucking tables would start flying<br>i mean it was a crazy place yeah<br>i would hate to live there<br>yeah i mean we saw many fights we see there<br>we saw so many fights and so many close fights<br>me and ariam has got enough fight at mcdonald’s yeah<br>just waiting in line for food yeah<br>dudes are way more aggressive in boston<br>than like say if you go out and<br>try to get some something to eat in texas<br>you know people are generally pretty fucking friendly<br>like everybody has this like<br>this stereotype of texas<br>but you’re way<br>safer going out to get some late night food in texas like<br>especially like austin<br>shit austin’s badass<br>that’s one of the friendliest fucking cities in the country<br>you know you want to go get something<br>to eat at two o’clock in the morning in austin<br>you’re fine you go<br>get something that eat at two o’clock in the morning in boston<br>you might see a fucking assault<br>you know you might be a part or something<br>you gotta watch where the fuck you’re gone<br>okay ladies and gentlemen we’re gonna go to the questions do you<br>there’s got to be something you’re not<br>looking forward to about fatherhood well i’m already a father<br>i love it you know<br>what you don’t look forward to is you<br>don’t look forward to the fact<br>that you’re going to lose a lot of your time<br>without a doubt you’re gonna have to spend<br>if you don’t want to be a shitty parent<br>you know if you have had<br>a childhood that was less than perfect<br>which i think most of us have<br>right<br>you learn from that<br>and you’re supposed to be a better person<br>and a better parent from that<br>and once you have a fucking kid man<br>it’s like all right you have this immense immense responsibility<br>to raise a human being correctly<br>and you gotta get your own shit together<br>you know<br>it forces you<br>and you’re going to definitely have to look at things<br>a little bit differently<br>because you’re not going to have the same amount of free time<br>and you can’t look at yourself like you’re the only thing<br>you know that’s what i was talking about before<br>with like a lot of people that i know that aren’t happy<br>one of the reasons why they’re not happies they don’t have<br>people in their life<br>you know like that are really important<br>you know like i know<br>dudes that are like grown men that don’t even have like really<br>really close friends<br>they have like friends<br>but they like<br>keep shit from them and you know sometimes they get in<br>bad arguments with them<br>and they don’t have anybody that they really open<br>up and are a hundred percent honest with<br>which is really huge<br>you know if you don’t have like a real friend<br>that you can fucking tell everything<br>too you gotta have those in your life<br>man those are huge when we’re all out<br>like when it’s me and brian and eddie and joey<br>and we’re all out<br>bullshitting we tell each other basically everything<br>you know that’s one of the fun things about it you know<br>one of the fun things about<br>hanging out with like people that you really like<br>is you know you get to see inside each other’s fucking<br>the wiring under the board<br>you get to see how your brain works you know you get to<br>throw out<br>the way you’re thinking and what’s going on your life to them<br>and see how you know a person<br>who’s not living your life<br>but loves you and looks out for you and wants you to be happy<br>gets to look at it and see it<br>and that’s very important for people<br>because sometimes you can’t see your life objectively<br>sometimes you need somebody in your life that<br>cares about you<br>and when people don’t have that shit<br>they don’t feel like they have<br>that a hundred percent honesty with someone<br>you’re disconnected to the universe<br>and that’s one of the reasons why people get so depressed<br>you know you’re depressed<br>because you don’t<br>have all this love in your life you have to have a lot of love<br>and you have to put it out there too<br>if you’re putting out shit you’re gonna get shit back<br>and then you’re gonna get<br>into a downward spiral that you’d ever gonna put out<br>pull out of you’re gonna have a shitty life<br>you’re putting out bad energy it’s always coming back<br>at you you’re always<br>gonna be unlucky you’re always gonna be unhappy<br>it’s just the way it is<br>if you’re an asshole<br>you’re not gonna be happy assholes<br>they look like they’re happy because you see them laughing<br>they go home and cry<br>and drink or their fucking<br>psycho and they have no emotions whatsoever<br>mean it but<br>no one is happy being negative everybody wants to be loving<br>everybody wants to have<br>good friends and have a good fucking time so<br>this operative grey guy you’re not gonna live forever bitch<br>and you’re not supposed to<br>you’re supposed to do what you can<br>to the people that<br>you influence and touch in this life<br>and hope that it carries on into the next<br>and we all know this<br>we all<br>know this inherently and we all know inherently the people<br>have done this to us<br>you know like i said we’ve all met people that inspired us<br>and i think that’s what we’re here for<br>i think that’s what we’re supposed to do<br>it’s just<br>you gonna cover are you playing shit<br>while i’m doing this while i’m talking what is this robot<br>why are you playing distracting shit<br>let me know when you playing shit tell me what it is<br>okay<br>it’s hard to read the questions off here man<br>any plans for a book yeah<br>i’m writing a book man<br>but the problem is i’m writing comedy at the same time and<br>i’m also writing blog entries<br>and i’m also trying to deal on my other bullshit so<br>it’s taken some time you know<br>it’s hard to sit down and just write a book<br>because i sit down and write things<br>and i just want to write about one thing that day and then<br>i like that’s one of the things i like about blogs<br>i could just write it and throw it up and bam there it is<br>but i’m always looking for new ways that people could<br>listen to<br>my shit get my ideas out there and get my stuff out there and<br>come to see me doing stand up and<br>you know the different ways to do that<br>you know it’s like<br>book books or legitimate ways there are ways<br>there’s still<br>a lot of people that<br>don’t even have any idea that i’m a stand up<br>comedian you know just because of like<br>stuff that i’ve done that’s not funny like fear factor and<br>whatever and you know and then doing<br>commentary for the ufc it’s the same thing it’s like<br>there’s a lot of people that really have no idea<br>that i’m even a comedian so i try to like do the best i can to<br>use all the different avenues to get that out there<br>so i think a book was gonna help<br>and also i think it’d be cool to have something<br>that i actually wrote that’s a book<br>you know i just think<br>having a real book<br>in the bookstore is something cool about that<br>book takes lots of concentrations smoke more weed<br>that’s an excellent advice i almost always write stoned<br>you know and it might not make sense then<br>the problem is i like read it when i’m not stoned<br>and i’m like what the fuck was i rambling about<br>but when i’m high<br>it’s all like super genius shit<br>yeah i was talking about depression<br>brian’s

my<br>phone fell in toilet<br>awesome awesome proud really i don’t get to dc very much<br>and the last time i was there before was<br>with<br>john hefferon charlie murphy when we did the maxim comedy tour<br>so you’re in miami beach florida next week right<br>yeah i’m in miami beach florida on the twenty second<br>which is what day is that<br>as far as looking at right now it is a<br>friday it’s

often<br>not in miami very often yeah but i’m here friday bitches<br>that’s gonna be fun that comedy show i guess<br>there’s gonna be a lot of people in town for that<br>you’re a lot of comics they’re gonna be in town for that yeah<br>yeah that sounds cool awesome<br>powerful comedy festival<br>and tickets are selling really fast so if you want to go<br>go to where they where the fuck can go<br>i think that one is<br>do have a link somewhere yeah<br>you know what<br>i’m gonna throw the link on twitter<br>because i’m such a badass bitch<br>that’s what i was gonna talk to you about what<br>it’s through live nation so if you get a livenation com yeah<br>each ticket they are charging seventeen like something crazy<br>fifteen dollars<br>like live nation<br>gets a cut service charge fifteen dollars service charge<br>for three<br>tickets some dude was saying that he was paying something<br>like insane like two hundred bucks or something really yeah<br>good check it let’s actually do it right now we do it why well<br>you know that’s one of the things i like about<br>like a regular goddamn comedy club a regular comedy club<br>was a ticket you cost twenty five bucks<br>you walk in the door you pay or twenty five bucks and that’s it<br>man yeah<br>you know or if you show up early you know<br>you go to the box office or you can order online<br>you just buy it from the club and that’s what it costs right<br>you go through an agency but<br>if you’re gonna do like a big concert or something like that<br>you have to go through an agency that’s another world<br>you know once you start doing like big venues<br>start doing like several thousand people<br>that’s that’s a totally different world<br>that’s why i love comedy clubs<br>first of all the show’s better<br>the shows<br>are always better when it’s like less than six hundred people<br>you know once you get over like six hundred people<br>they’re still fun there’s still a lot of fun<br>you know dc was more than six hundred people i think<br>but they’re still<br>it’s still a good time don’t get me wrong<br>but it’s just not the same experience<br>the experience you get in the comedy club it’s like you’re right<br>there you’re in the mix there’s<br>low ceilings and shit and it’s just<br>three hundred of you and you’re fucking around just hanging out<br>okay three tickets<br>try to get to the grand total tell me<br>hundred and fifty nine dollars in sixty cents<br>for three tickets that’s a lot of money mode<br>have i smoked weed with doug benson probably<br>i don’t remember that i must have<br>i might not have though<br>i think i did once i think i showed him the solo pipe<br>i was gonna get him one i think<br>doug’s a very nice guy<br>yeah he’s a record yeah<br>very nice guy and i did his podcast he’s very fun too<br>he’s got a<br>i love movie’s podcast but i was totally useless on it because<br>i’m not a big movie fan<br>so they were talking like they were all going on especially<br>patent patton i was what was on he’s a movie freak<br>and they were just quoted all these<br>weird obscure movies<br>and weird obscure and i just didn’t know anything<br>that was useless<br>they were like what’s your favorite movie i’m like god<br>don’t have one<br>you have a favorite movie<br>i don’t think i have a favorite movie man<br>right now it’s avatar<br>just because i<br>never get<br>i’ve never felt like that before you know yeah<br>like in a movie like wow<br>like that movie like<br>even though it was dumb<br>you know even though it was like cliche it didn’t matter it<br>felt it felt so powerful<br>you know like i was like moved to tears<br>almost a couple times it’s like<br>i mean even though it was still it was like comic book<br>style but super powerful<br>you know like the images and the way it was done<br>even though there was some like some cliche shit in it<br>doesn’t matter man<br>oh fuck it awesome<br>did i get my tomahawk pipe yes i did sir<br>actually there it is right here<br>but we haven’t used it because it’s kind of weak<br>it’s very clogged<br>already yeah well<br>it’s just it’s a it’s dumb<br>it’s done you’re not really supposed to smoke out of it<br>you’re supposed to describe me<br>i’ve got a comma hard pack man<br>it’s silly<br>but yeah i got it<br>i got it just so i could show you guys i got it<br>one that i started smoking weed<br>i didn’t start tall i was like thirty years old<br>that’s why i’m so passionate about it because my whole life<br>i thought that if you swamp weed you’d be lazy<br>you’d be a loser<br>because i knew a lot of dudes when i was a kid and<br>the guys had big drugs<br>the guys that<br>were partying all the time<br>they always wanted to fucking their lives up<br>and i was terrified of fucking my life up<br>there was my number one fear with being a loser<br>my number one<br>i didn’t my ambition was all fucked up<br>because it wasn’t that i wanted to be<br>happy and i wanted to you know find some place of<br>some point of success and<br>do you know achieve some goal or you know be the<br>something for a living that i wanted to be<br>i wasn’t doing that<br>i was just trying not to be a loser i was<br>terrified that i was gonna be a loser<br>so<br>you know i think<br>i think that’s it it’s very important<br>to have the right<br>mindset don’t you think like when you’re growing up<br>how gigantic is that yeah<br>i think it’s a lot with parents but also<br>you know just how you’re raised in the whole package yeah<br>how people how you<br>the people around you think too that’s very important<br>you know i don’t even remember what i was talking about<br>that’s how high we are razor gentlemen<br>barbecued<br>but we were talking to something real simple what the hell is it<br>we’re talking about avatar and<br>by the way i finally sell saw<br>in three d and i loved it that fucking movie was so great<br>it was the greatest movie ever<br>to me i mean i say i don’t have a favorite movie<br>but i guess if i had to have a favorite movie<br>that’s my favorite movie<br>any news on brock lesson<br>i heard randy corteur said he’s back in the gym really yeah<br>that’s awesome you know more important than anything<br>even if the dude never fights again right<br>you know maybe he doesn’t want to fight anymore now you know<br>the most important thing is that he’s healthy<br>and the most important thing is you<br>ladies and gentlemen learn something from this situation<br>eat your vegetables<br>it’s very important eat your fiber<br>you gotta clean out your intestinal tract by juicer<br>by juicer this motherfucker has been juicing<br>juicing like craziness his whole life is like invigorated<br>right don’t you don’t you feel like oh<br>it’s immediately like five minutes after<br>taking one of these juices<br>i feel like i could just go<br>do jumping jacks why isn’t this wackass thing streaming anymore<br>i don’t know man i got safari to safari suck<br>i use chrome now oh this is this is firefox you know what<br>i’m gonna try<br>to shut this bitch off yes<br>chrome i’ve been using chrome a lot lately i like chrome a lot<br>think it’s the best so<br>i don’t know that or so far he’s the best i gave up on firefox<br>firefox has been the worst<br>lately firefox has just been slow as fuck<br>really yeah they used to be good<br>yeah firefox crashes sometimes on me<br>shut off firefox<br>i got all my fancy new fucking badass quick internet<br>that shouldn’t be all gayed out<br>a lot of people got really mad at me i did an interview recently<br>and i talked about<br>the use of the word faggot<br>i was just explaining how what happened when i did the spike tv<br>thing that they told me that i could say any word except faggot<br>when the show was uncensored<br>and<br>i was like this that’s so crazy because i’m not even talking to<br>a person i’m talking to a dog<br>and some ants that’s when i use the word faggot<br>and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation<br>you know and i know louis c k<br>actually has a bit on that about<br>how it never meant gay<br>and it didn’t anthony kumi it talks about it all the time<br>on opiate anthony<br>about how faggot never<br>really was a homosexual slurring or kids it was<br>it was not i mean but<br>that’s true but it’s sort of not true because you knew that<br>it also meant that<br>but people didn’t use it that way that’s not what it meant<br>and at the end of the day like<br>what’s language is supposed to represent is<br>your the context of your thoughts<br>you know and the problem is when words<br>get hyper powered<br>like cunt or nigger or faggot now faggot is like the new one<br>you know or love loves a hyper powered word too you know<br>these words get hyper powered and the word itself is more<br>important than the meaning behind the word<br>you’re not it’s not a true expression anymore<br>like<br>i mean a lot of people in relationships and you know you say<br>say you love me tell me you love me i really love you<br>it’s like this weird<br>fucking magic word thing that you have to say<br>it’s like you should know by the way<br>someone communicates with you whether or not they love you<br>it shouldn’t have to say<br>this one word shouldn’t have all this goddamn power<br>you know the same thing with the word nigger and the same thing<br>with the word faggots<br>and now i guess<br>because this gay guy told me when he was explaining this to me<br>that i couldn’t say faggot<br>even if i didn’t mean anything<br>it didn’t mean gay people i couldn’t say it because i’m not gay<br>he said but gay people could say<br>because he goes it’s our nigger laugh<br>guys kisses as john volta who’s he kissing<br>john javolta’s i don’t know some duty met on the streets wow<br>that’s shocking news tv<br>what’s great you can get me sued who’s he kissing<br>obviously it’s stage ladies and gentlemen well<br>it’s not this one’s not stage from<br>where he’s getting into an airplane kissing another gentleman<br>well you know<br>maybe he looks kissing gentlemen doesn’t mean he’s gay brian<br>yeah i don’t know where you’re going with this<br>listen just cuz john turolta is kissing manny’s photos<br>and one of the funniest thing you ever said dude was<br>you want to say<br>which<br>john dr volta is gary then a room full of dicks do i say that<br>yeah in vegas<br>one of my favorite things yes well<br>clearly i was just setting it in jest ladies and gentlemen<br>i did not know who’s homosexual<br>there’s a funny story that i have october before<br>but it’s true story there was a dude who was a fighter in this<br>organization this other fighting organization outside of the ufc<br>and this is like the nineties and they want to do<br>it wasn’t a google search<br>even it was an internet search on this man’s name<br>because<br>they were going to write a story about him to promote his show<br>and as they were searching him<br>they found out that someone with the same name<br>was a gay porn star<br>and not just a gay porn star<br>but<br>the winner of the hungriest butt contest<br>not the runner up with the hungriest butt contest<br>the fucking winner<br>this dude won the hungriest butt contest<br>and<br>they didn’t believe it was him and then they just started like<br>like searching more<br>and they found photos<br>and they found photos of him<br>like one dudes in his mouth one dudes in his ass<br>and they’re using him as like<br>chinese finger handcuffs<br>and i mean they found all this porn on him like because<br>it was you know it was used pretty easy to find<br>you know when the information first got on the internet<br>porn was the first shit to get out there<br>porn was there before anything else<br>before wikipedia before<br>youtube porn was there<br>so if you had porn on the internet<br>or you could basically get even stuff that was illegal<br>like the early tracy lords videos you could have got<br>those elite<br>you could have got those back that you can’t get those now<br>you go looking for a tracy lords video now anything<br>that’s illegal like that that shit is gone<br>but back then you could get it so gay porn<br>it was all over the place<br>this poor fuck they pulled up all these pictures<br>videos and everything<br>and they confronted him<br>and he was like<br>bullshit that’s putting them they showed in the photos<br>and he got all angry<br>and he was the headliner he was like the big draw<br>and he just explained that<br>he looked he was down on his luck and it was a lot of money<br>it was a lot of money and so he did it<br>well it turns out he did like a hundred movies<br>and the joke is how much money is a lot of money to you<br>because if i think<br>you do one movie<br>you live like you’re in a jz video for the rest of your life<br>that’s what i think you want to do gay sex on video what<br>that’s i gotta see some zeros<br>i gotta see a lot of commas and a lot of zeros you know<br>but this fucking guy did like a lot of these<br>and my the joke is<br>a hundred and fifteen videos by my accounts you should have<br>all the money in the world<br>there should be no more money left for anybody else<br>unless you like it see if you like<br>suck index and if you’re gay then that’s not bad at all<br>there’s not see<br>this is what people don’t understand<br>like just because someone thinks it’s funny because<br>they personally are not they don’t want to have gay sex<br>that doesn’t mean it’s bad that you have gay sex it’s only<br>bad for someone who doesn’t want to have the gay sex right brian<br>like if you’re not gay and you do a gay porn<br>that’s a big deal<br>but if you’re gay and you do a gay porn it’s like so up<br>you’re sucking dicks<br>is it any more embarrassing that you’re doing a video<br>it’s the same<br>it’s no different<br>but if you’re straight and you’re out<br>there belong guys on video<br>i still bit about it in my act that<br>if a guy is like straight and he’s blown a guy<br>you know that<br>if you like made a mistake one night and<br>you’ll never win an argument ever for the rest of your life<br>because as soon as you get in the argument<br>soon as shit starts getting real like man<br>you don’t even believe people<br>in the moon like didn’t you suck a dick once<br>and that’s the end the art argument’s over<br>there’s no way you can bounce back from that you know<br>what<br>you had to dig in your mouth his conversation’s over<br>you know you can’t trust his gentleman anymore you’ve<br>defeated him you’ve deflated him as a human<br>do i feel very blessed to be as famous as i am says<br>genuine evil eighty six that’s hilarious<br>i’m just famous enough where it’s not creepy<br>you know i’m just famous enough where no one takes me seriously<br>first of all fear factor was definitely a blessing in disguise<br>because you know i’m saying like you know you get to<br>a place where like a lot of people<br>aren’t like real super famous<br>people that are like loved and worshipped like<br>you know rock stars or michael jackson<br>or something like that or tom cruise<br>or brad pitt like<br>they’re prisoners<br>like they can’t go anywhere like that is a terrible way to live<br>like yeah everybody is fascinated by you including me if i saw<br>a brad pitt in a restaurant<br>i was like point stare<br>like me you wanna hear something crazy me and kevin james okay<br>and kevin james is fucking famous right<br>that that goddamn<br>paul blart mall cop movie he did made like two<br>hundred million dollars okay<br>kevin and i are in boston and we’re in a hotel room<br>and<br>tom cruise was in boston too and tom cruise was on the street<br>okay and we’re kevin’s fucking hotel room<br>and kevin’s like tom cruises out there look<br>and so we’re like leaning out the window<br>looking at tom cruise<br>and we’re on the like the tenth floor and shit<br>and tom cruises on the ground floor<br>and we’re like looking at him across the street like woo<br>a movie star is gawking at another movie star<br>it was pretty interesting to watch i was like<br>you’re i go do you know you’re that famous<br>like he’s not as famous as tom cruise<br>but he’s fucking really famous i mean it’s silly that he’s<br>like so fat but that’s what it is man people people<br>are nutty about fame that’s not a good level<br>you don’t want to be there that<br>you want to be at the level<br>where you don’t have to worry about your bills<br>and you<br>you know you’re able to do what you want to do<br>like as far as creatively<br>you know<br>that’s what i like i like the fact that i could do comedy<br>i could do the ufc<br>i do what i want to do and i’m enjoying myself you know<br>and people enjoy what i’m doing<br>and you know you develop fans<br>you develop people that are appreciating what you do<br>and you appreciate them<br>and it’s a good relationship that’s a good level of fame<br>you don’t want to be you know<br>you don’t want to be somewhere like<br>i was watching some video online where the guy<br>could you put that video up the dude when george bush went to<br>a restaurant and he’s with five secret service agents and<br>the guy screaming and yelling at him<br>you fucking murder or you zionist murdering<br>piece of shit and<br>some god george bush senior<br>has to the dude is like he’s an old man<br>he’s been around forever<br>he has to travel everywhere with these<br>bodyguards everywhere<br>he goes he has secret service guy surrounding him<br>and yeah i know what you’re saying yeah no<br>he caused wars and he’s responsible for all these people dying i<br>see it a hundred percent<br>it’s not like being a movie star<br>but it’s the same thing in as far as like<br>well no because people are angry at him okay<br>it’s my point is terrible<br>but it is right<br>because people are angry at him<br>i mean he’s the reason why he’s got all these people around<br>because people want him dead yeah well<br>then anybody wants brad pitt dead is fucking crazy<br>but the point is any level of a fame<br>you know past a certain level can be it becomes a handicap<br>it becomes like food if you have some food<br>you should only eat until you’re not hungry anymore<br>you shouldn’t fucking<br>gorge yourself and go god damn crazy<br>you know it’s very difficult to manage any level of fame<br>and to manage the kind of fame that those guys<br>manage i mean it’s almost impossible that’s why<br>why do you think tom cruise is so crazy you have to be crazy<br>no one cannot be crazy if you’re that famous<br>it’s like impossible<br>like who can manage that kind of fame<br>you know like<br>when he was on matt lower talking about<br>psychiatrists and anti depressants like<br>matt your glib<br>your glib like he doesn’t even realize how retarded he sounds<br>no one tells him<br>no one tells him that he’s talking nonsense he doesn’t have<br>a voice of reason<br>around him he doesn’t have objectivity<br>he doesn’t have anybody who talks to him real<br>he has people who gawk and stare<br>and look<br>like kevin james and i from the fucking tenth floor of a hotel<br>oh it’s tom cruise no one’s given that guy the real shit<br>so when he gets on television talks to nonsense<br>he has no idea what nonsense is he’s crazy because he’s super<br>super famous<br>and it’s almost impossible to not be crazy where all the rules<br>are completely different<br>for you than they are for everybody else<br>the rules for everybody else are totally<br>most people have to create an impression they have you<br>meet someone that you know you tell them<br>what your name is what you’re all about<br>with him everywhere he goes they know everything<br>they know he’s a scientologist<br>they know he’s the greatest fucking<br>most successful movie star in the history of the world<br>i mean that fucking god can’t go anywhere<br>everybody wants to say he’s like five foot one<br>and oh he’s gay and he’s fucking crit<br>and everybody’s staring and scrutinizing them you know that<br>marries<br>but he had the first one to call the kidman that was all set up<br>and that was not even real and<br>everybody’s constantly up in his shit how could he not be crazy<br>right yeah<br>brian gets up<br>he gets a lot of internet fame<br>he got a lot of weirdos they get upset at you<br>you got a lot of weird how about that pepsi spice thing<br>listen listen to this story<br>this dude when pepsi<br>remember when pepsi spice was around<br>well brian is like one of the og internet gangsters he was like<br>he was aware of shit the companies weren’t aware of<br>you know companies were like these<br>multi multi billion dollar companies but they really weren’t<br>deep in the internet they didn’t understand the impact it had<br>so when pepsi spice came out<br>they didn’t have pepsispice com so brian bought pepsispice com<br>and brian started putting up all these<br>crazy is it still up or did you get sued<br>the website yeah<br>i let it go because i was tired of paying for it<br>and they weren’t bringing back the<br>did you give it to them<br>no i just let it go<br>on somebody else picked it up<br>but what did you do with all those<br>crazy stories that you wrote on it<br>we’ll tell everybody about the stores well pretty much i just<br>copied off that<br>morgan spurlock guy and i said that i was going to drink<br>only pepsi holiday spice for thirty days<br>for the people that don’t know that’s from supersizing me<br>eight mcdonald’s for thirty days it’s a documentary pretty good<br>one yeah<br>and so<br>i could only have pepsi spicy eat and drink for thirty days<br>which is alone<br>the dumbest thing in the road that anyone believed it<br>you know like i’m not gonna eat food<br>i’m gonna you know have so<br>i started having like the first couple days<br>i started having like these like<br>lesions and stuff like that<br>and you photoshop these things on yeah<br>yeah i made like fake things i made myself look more and more<br>sick i was losing weight and i was showing like my<br>i was photoshopping fat off me<br>and what’s crazy is then<br>i started getting interviews from radio stations<br>thinking it’s real i have that somewhere like this<br>two hour interview where<br>college radio station was real<br>and i had<br>people actually<br>i started like really<br>thinking i was like dying and stuff like that<br>and then one day i just stopped like twenty days in<br>and people all thought i’d die<br>it was one of the great trolls<br>one of the all time great trolls yeah<br>it was really brilliant yeah<br>just look at pepsi spice project it’s been someone’s gone<br>god damn brilliant trolls<br>down the internet<br>you know the best is dougstan hope<br>baiting baiting org<br>dougstan hope would go and bait pedophiles<br>and then write<br>like i think they did a book about it then they do a book<br>they put in a book former thing yeah<br>i think so i believe it’s still available<br>on if you go to dougstanhope com<br>you’ll probably<br>have a link to it somewhere because one of the funniest things<br>that doug ever did and he would pretend to be little girls<br>and lure pedophiles and say like all kinds of fucked up shit<br>and it was really really genius stuff<br>i don’t i can’t pull any of the quotes off the top of my head<br>but i remember<br>really laughing really hard<br>and wanting to do the same thing<br>but i don’t have that kind of commitment<br>doug is an animal he’s a pitbull<br>level commitment that he has towards trolling i i don’t know<br>i’m not into like goofing on people<br>i don’t know why like that like i get bored<br>i mean<br>i’ll argue with people<br>and i’ll make fun of someone<br>but like pretending to be someone else going back and<br>forth for whatever reason<br>my brain doesn’t work that way you know<br>i don’t know why i don’t get into those trolls<br>but i love watching them<br>like that pepsi spice one<br>i love that one that was awesome and dugs i loved them<br>i just don’t i don’t<br>my brain doesn’t think like that<br>here’s that here’s<br>when i actually<br>this

i can’t do it<br>i understand it if you like it<br>it’s not my shit i like some rap music i like seventies music<br>the midnight rider from the almond brothers i don’t know<br>if it sounded good to you guys<br>it sound awesome it’s a great goddamn fucking song<br>just a<br>some of the shit they did in the seventies man<br>that stuff just so resonates today<br>man you know you listen to some<br>some of the sixties and seventies music zeppelin into the doors<br>and just there’s something<br>about it man that like when i’m like in a mood<br>i want to hear something<br>especially smoke<br>a joint<br>and you know you sit in front of computer you want to write<br>i put on some fucking classic rock man it just it makes you<br>it just makes you feel<br>more connected<br>there’s just like there’s something about that music like<br>whatever they were doing at the time<br>and they were making that music<br>they were nailing it<br>they<br>you know there’s music from that era that doesn’t smell at all<br>like commercial it doesn’t smell at all like<br>like they were trying to<br>you know to trick people<br>or do something<br>they thought was gonna be successful<br>there’s a bunch of music from the era<br>that’s just beautiful man it’s just a live it’s like the pure<br>the purest version<br>of musical art<br>you know and i think<br>it’s cause they were all doing psychedelic drugs i mean<br>i think that i had a lot to do with it everybody was high<br>everybody was smoking pot<br>they were dropping acid and taking mushrooms and<br>they were coming out with dope fucking music man<br>and today still to this day<br>i mean no one’s gonna be listening to pop pop<br>pop<br>pop poke or face no one’s gonna listen to that in thirty years<br>no one’s gonna listen to that forty years<br>legzeppin will still be around in forty years<br>forty years from now<br>some fucking dude in a spaceship<br>is gonna turn<br>some other dude in a spaceship on a whole lot of love<br>probably not forty years will still be stuck on his planet<br>four hundred years from now<br>that should be like mosar<br>no one’s gonna remember po<br>po poker face no one’s gonna remember that right<br>don’t you agree i don’t know it’s a pretty big song<br>i think he’s just hating<br>do you think i’m hating you like that song<br>i think it was okay at the beginning<br>but i mean the main thing that who cares about me that’s like<br>a number one song you know<br>not every song it’s number one you know<br>what is that will people remember it i don’t know<br>i think that sounds horrible<br>does anybody here i mean i like lady gaga it’s not bad<br>yeah this dude is down man<br>kevin newcom knows what the fuck i’m talking about<br>says they have the best music the almond brothers just<br>they’re just soulful man<br>there’s something about those<br>when joey dears describes<br>it is the best those dirty motherfucking white boys<br>dirty white boys from florida are you

week we’re gonna drag him in here next week<br>even if we have to change the schedule for the show<br>and do it at a different time alright now<br>because i didn’t look at this at all the last time we did this<br>i have to look at it now met here for me<br>yeah i made up a post on my message board asking people<br>to put in questions<br>so<br>because of that i’m going to go there right now and check out<br>what their questions are see if anybody had some cool shit<br>because people were upset that i<br>did it last week<br>but when i did it last week i didn’t answer any questions<br>but<br>i mean<br>i like the questions and it’s good to have the questions but<br>i wanted to make this as loose as possible<br>i want to make this as much as whatever<br>we feel like talking about<br>you know whatever<br>whoever’s here whatever<br>just let things come out<br>you know let and answer twitter questions and all that shit<br>what are the best tips for navigating a high dose mushroom trip<br>are you doing them regularly that’s the first question<br>i don’t do it regularly<br>terence mckenna who i learned everything<br>i know about psychedelics from that guy or at least<br>that’s where i started is<br>listening to what he had to say reading his books<br>but what he always said is that you should do them in<br>high doses and<br>very rarely that’s what he said<br>he said that psychedel experiences should be something<br>where you do<br>the right dose and then you take a long time off and<br>sort of contemplate what happened<br>and i agree with that<br>the last time i did anything<br>really strong like dmt that was over two years ago<br>and it was because<br>it was a<br>very very very profound experience and i wanted to make sure<br>that i got as much out of it and it understood it and<br>sort of deciphered it as much as i could<br>and applied it to my life as much as i could before<br>i just went to try to do it again<br>i’m very serious about psychedelic trips i don’t think<br>it’s play i mean<br>i think you can have a good time<br>on mushrooms with your buddies if you don’t take too much<br>but i think you can get a lot out of psychedelic trips where<br>you and i’m not criticizing people want to do it for fun<br>because look i like to drink for fun<br>i smoke pot for fun<br>i smoke pot both for introspective quality<br>thinking and also for fun<br>and i don’t if you want to do it for fun that’s all good<br>but what i’m saying is like for me<br>personally i’ve learned a lot from<br>psychedelic experiences and<br>what i believe is what terrence mckenna’s always said<br>is that you should do them<br>very rarely you do them and<br>then you don’t do shit for a while<br>and you think about what the fuck you learned<br>because it doesn’t if you really want to prove yourself<br>you’re really using it for that reason<br>to really expand your consciousness<br>you don’t<br>get anything out of it if you can’t apply it to your life<br>you can’t just have the experience<br>and then become some fucking shut in<br>who doesn’t interact with the rest of the world<br>because all you want to do is<br>you know go down<br>your basement and turn the lights out and do mushrooms<br>like you now you’re not even a part of us anymore like<br>you should be able to<br>you’ve got to be able to function in both worlds<br>in the psychedelic world<br>and in this world<br>you got to be able to navigate both dimensions<br>and i think if you do too much<br>drugs if you do them all the time you know you can<br>you can definitely lose<br>your handle on this world<br>so that’s my answer to that question i think<br>if you’re if you’re doing anything<br>consciousness expanding you know<br>and always do things that have been<br>done for thousands and thousands of years i mean<br>i’m not telling you to do anything illegal<br>but there’s stuff that you can do that isn’t illegal they just<br>haven’t classified yet<br>you know ayahuasca isn’t technically illegal dmt is illegal<br>ayawaska has even been sanctioned recently<br>some church in new mexico want a<br>supreme court case where<br>they take dmt it’s part of their christian church<br>it’s part of their religious ceremonies to get in touch<br>with god<br>yeah<br>they want a supreme court case for a few people know about it<br>but<br>you should know what the fuck you’re doing<br>and that’s the real problem<br>with psychedelics is that there are no shaman anymore<br>you know in the in you know these<br>tribes in peru and these people that live in the amazon<br>there is<br>like a history of usage that goes back thousands of years<br>and they pass it on from generation to generation<br>and the shaman<br>the people that like brew this ayahuaska is a very powerful<br>dose of<br>dmt that comes in an orderly active form<br>and they get it from combining these plants and boiling<br>into this crazy mixture<br>between that<br>and there’s also shaman and other parts of the world in mexico<br>where<br>they they’re shaman where they they’re the thing is mushrooms<br>and these are people that have navigated these dimensions<br>whether it’s iowascar mushrooms or payoti<br>they’ve navigated these dimensions many many many<br>many times so they can tell you what to expect there<br>they’ve learned from their experiences and they can help you<br>you know i think that’s the real problems that<br>psychedelic drugs aren’t necessarily bad for you<br>they’re just illegal<br>and when they’re illegal<br>they can be bad for you because if you can caught with them<br>you can get locked up<br>your life can<br>get fucked up<br>if they find them on your in your piss<br>if you have to you know test<br>for some sort of a job and then also<br>you label the drug addict yeah in that sense<br>sagadel of drugs can be bad and the other sense it’s like<br>look<br>a circular saw like one of those<br>those are awesome if you know how to use one<br>you could build a house<br>you could you could fucking do some cool shit<br>you can<br>cut some wood that you would never be able to cut with like a<br>steak knife but<br>it doesn’t mean everybody<br>should have a fucking circular saw and just be using it all day<br>and that’s the same thing with mushrooms<br>mushrooms are just like any kind of tool<br>you can like i say with marijuana with a hammer<br>you can build a house with a hammer<br>or you can just<br>hit yourself in the dick if you’re fucking crazy<br>it doesn’t mean that hammer should be illegal<br>and that’s the same thing with psychedelic trucks<br>i wouldn’t give a circular saw to a thirteen year old boy<br>and say hey go play with this<br>but if a guy is a goddamn carpenter<br>he knows what he’s doing<br>and he’s gone gone up through trade school<br>and<br>he didn’t apprenticeship and worked as a carpenter’s apprentice<br>and learned how to use tools properly and learn<br>the proper safety precautions then yeah<br>that guy should<br>be able to hold a fucking chainsaw<br>that guy should be able to use a circular saw<br>that guys should be able to work in a machine chop<br>he’s learned how to do it<br>and that’s the same<br>thing with psychedelic drugs there should be someone<br>showing you the dangers and the pitfalls<br>and what it’s all about because it’s not simply<br>that easy<br>it’s not like you can just do them and you’re going to be okay<br>some people do psychedelic drugs<br>and they’re so<br>unmentally prepared for that they’re never the same again<br>you know<br>and that’s a real possibility and someone needs to be there<br>to evaluate whether or not you know<br>you’ve got<br>the proper information with your heads in the right place<br>you know and that that’s why it would help if we were more open<br>about these fucking things<br>and it’s the nutty thing is it’s<br>it’s still got this terrible reputation<br>and here we are you know in two thousand and ten<br>and i think the reputation is all<br>based on the fact that<br>when we get something in our head we stick with it<br>we get something in our head even<br>with all the information like marijuana still illegal<br>two thousand and ten and most states it’s illegal you know<br>that’s crazy when alcohol and tobacco<br>and all that shit is readily available<br>but we get it in our head that it’s bad because<br>it’s been illegal all our lives<br>it’s a very tough for us to change gears and for a long time<br>we’ve had this thing in our head about psychedelic drugs<br>and it’s just a cultural pattern you know<br>it’s just a lock we got talked into it when the media was young<br>and when the newspapers were around<br>and that was the only way to get information out<br>they would publish these stories about marijuana<br>and the william randolph hearst scandals<br>the william randolph hearst owned<br>not only did he own newspapers<br>but he also owned paper mills<br>and when they invented a decordicator<br>it made it more effective to process hemp fiber<br>and what he started doing was attacking the hemp industry<br>so that he didn’t have to change over his paper mills from wood<br>to hemp paper<br>this hemp is a far superior paper<br>it makes superior clothing<br>it’s you can eat it like the<br>it contains all the essential amino acids and the seeds<br>besides the fact that it gets you high<br>even take a way that gets you high part<br>even the plants that don’t get you high at all are still<br>like really economically valuable well<br>william ran off hers attacked that industry<br>because he on the newspapers he started printing these stories<br>saying that blacks and mexicans were<br>smoking this new drug called marijuana<br>and they were going out and raping white lemon<br>and so because of that because he did this they all<br>you know people<br>got crazy and they all got paranoid and congress actually<br>outlawed marijuana not even<br>knowing that they were outlawing hemp<br>they didn’t even know it was the same thing<br>so that’s how marijuana became illegal in the first place<br>and that’s why it’s still illegal<br>today is that once something is stocking our consciousness<br>it takes a long time to get it out well<br>i think that a long time ago a long time ago it was probably<br>very very common<br>you know in all cultures to have a shaman to have some sort of<br>you know someone who is aware of psychedelic states you know<br>john marco legro<br>he argues that that’s what christianity is all about<br>the christianity is all about concealing these secrets of<br>consuming hallucinogenic drugs<br>he was a guy who deciphered the dead sea scrolls<br>john marco allegro<br>worked in the dead sea scrolls for fourteen years<br>and after he did all this decipher now<br>i don’t know if he’s right<br>neither do you unless you’re a biblical scholar unless you can<br>you know you have to be<br>a master of ancient languages you have to study it for decades<br>even understand what the fuck he’s talking about<br>i read it it’s like<br>makes sense sort of but<br>he could be totally bullshitting but what his story is was that<br>the entire christian religion was a giant misunderstanding<br>what it really<br>was all about<br>was the consumption<br>of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults<br>and that’s what it was all about it was all about breeding<br>babies and taking mushrooms<br>which makes sense<br>people<br>live thousands and thousands years ago and didn’t know what<br>the sky was they didn’t have any science<br>and they’re popping mushrooms they would<br>they wouldn’t want other people to know how<br>badass the mushrooms<br>are you eat mushrooms<br>you see god they wouldn’t want other people to know about that<br>so they would hide it in stories it totally makes sense<br>some guy said i’ve tried roba tessan<br>what are you kidding dukakas pal<br>drinking roba tessan<br>what else you drinking after shea fella<br>agreed this guy says he hates everything in the radio<br>i don’t hate everything on the radio<br>but god damn i hate a lot of songs<br>i think this is just a certain reality and like a lot of<br>rap and a lot of classic rock<br>i like sound guard<br>too i love sound garden i heard they’re getting back together<br>again which i love<br>because i was not a fan of that chris cornell shit on his own<br>yeah lately i haven’t been a fan at all<br>he seems like a really cool guy<br>and he’s a talented as fuck as a singer<br>but there’s like<br>some bands they get together they got a magic you know<br>i don’t think<br>even if they get back together<br>i don’t think it’s gonna be that good<br>really yeah<br>i think a lot of bands like sound garden they were good<br>because they were young and they were<br>doing drugs and going crazy and just experiencing life<br>now i think these are just people that have slowed down<br>slowed their role and they’re trying to be something<br>or not cause yeah<br>they’re music just a lot of these guys as music just<br>you know<br>i think that was kind of when i was talking about earlier<br>when i was saying that there’s a certain level<br>that you reach as<br>a performer you know<br>if you get too famous you get too successful it’s very hard<br>to cope very hard to be still creative and still have<br>enthusiasm i mean how many guys<br>just get better and better every album it’s not that many<br>it’s very hard to pull off<br>who do you think has ever done it the longest<br>most consistently<br>rolls that blend<br>one of those guys<br>probably the beatles did it forever right<br>yeah did they ever follow any part<br>they got better right yeah they got better<br>yeah they did right<br>yeah they got into their psychedelic stage<br>you know they’re fucking<br>the white album stage<br>here plays rock band better beatles rock band<br>no it’s great because he started off<br>like shitty beatles songs<br>and you’re just like this song<br>sucks whatever<br>and then you start getting into like psychedelic<br>and it’s just it’s cool<br>the more you play the more into the music<br>well they didn’t just<br>see the thing about the beatles was<br>they didn’t just change their music<br>they changed<br>like the whole culture that was listening to them too<br>because people got swept up in their music<br>you know people were such huge fans of john lennon<br>when he started getting into transcendental meditation<br>and acid and hanging out with gurus and shit<br>they all got into it too<br>he changed a lot of people’s consciousness<br>that was a guy that really<br>really affected a lot of the way<br>our culture operates the way people think<br>michael Jackson too<br>fuck yeah<br>yeah yeah michael Jackson just from<br>the music how powerful it was like bad and thriller<br>man when I was a kid there was<br>nothing that was more popular than that<br>yeah it’s like<br>it was so recognized that his talent was just so<br>far and above everyone else’s<br>and you know everybody’s like god<br>it’s so sad that he’s such a freak and he’s so crazy<br>but the more I’ve been thinking lightly<br>I think that when you get to<br>a certain level I think there’s a certain level of<br>greatness that some people achieve<br>like a certain frequency that some people achieve<br>and it’s almost impossible to achieve<br>if you’re not insane<br>it’s almost impossible to push yourself that far<br>that hard<br>because it’s not easy to be like michael Jackson<br>it’s so fucking hard<br>it’s not just a natural talent<br>it’s a focus and an energy<br>and that focus requires like<br>a very singular way of looking at things and a very<br>a lot of sexual absence<br>a lot of sexual abuse<br>I think definitely helps too right<br>jake’s in the back of his<br>what do you think you think<br>that’s what happened with him<br>you think he was abused when he was a kid<br>I think probably<br>I mean well it’s all speculated maybe all work<br>he could have been that he just got<br>so fucked up because<br>he got so famous when he was so young<br>that he never felt like he had a chance to grow up<br>and he wanted to go back to when he was a child<br>and he was just so psychologically damaged<br>that he literally wanted to be around children<br>because he wanted to<br>revert back to that moment in his life before<br>he realized that life was haywire<br>you know I’ve thought that before because you know what<br>the thing is about<br>all these child molesting<br>accusations is that he was always<br>around all these<br>poor kids<br>and trying to help all these kids with cancer and shit<br>and people who were broke<br>and it’s like after a while I mean these people like<br>all they have to do is say<br>some crazy shit about michael Jackson<br>and you know it looks weird<br>why is michael<br>Jackson hanging out with kids all the time<br>all I have to do is say some crazy shit<br>and he’s got to pay<br>you things gotta pay<br>you start going to the newspaper<br>and to these people that were super broke<br>I mean that’d be so tempting<br>here’s this billionaire the biggest<br>rockstar music star in the history of the world<br>and he’s hanging out with your kid<br>and he’s got your kid over for sleepovers<br>you start I believe it though in some I bet<br>what I’m saying is<br>there’s not like a whole<br>bunch of people coming out saying he fucked them<br>he wouldn’t just fuck a couple kids right<br>you’d be fucking kids all over the place right<br>especially if you’re michael Jackson<br>you’d be like the tiger woods of kid fucking<br>you’d be just banging kids all over the place<br>you would if you got that obsession<br>where you want to have sex<br>with kids if you look at like pachama lesters<br>like the recidivism rate is through the roof<br>it’s crazy it’s like in the 99% or something like that<br>I don’t know it’s<br>I just made that number up<br>it’s real high though whatever it is I’ve read it<br>I don’t remember what the numbers are<br>but<br>people have said time and time again<br>it’s very difficult to reform someone<br>so if he’s like banging kids<br>he’s not just gonna bang one or two<br>but that’s why he had kids<br>and he called the kid blanket because he’s always<br>on top of him<br>that’s what<br>seriously though like that<br>I mean if you’re a child molester and you get copped<br>wouldn’t you have kids<br>you’re just saying good enough<br>yeah but you’re saying that no<br>none of his kids have ever come out<br>and accused him of doing that<br>you can’t just say that you’re just you’re adding<br>no you’re making<br>I’m not saying that’s what’s true I’m just saying that<br>but I’m gonna say that’s what I believe in<br>I don’t believe<br>that he probably<br>slept with kids and he probably kissed him<br>but I don’t think he’s like<br>you know<br>like doggy style on the side of the bed or anything<br>like that<br>so you think he just did an appropriate shit yeah<br>I bet he’s just because he thinks he’s a kid you know<br>maybe yeah<br>maybe he was molested at by his father growing up<br>you think so I bet that’s<br>because I mean<br>miley cyrus would be<br>fucking black by now if that was true<br>you know somebody said this<br>I don’t know who said this but I don’t know<br>not given credit but I don’t remember who it was<br>they said that<br>they think that michael Jackson might have been<br>castrated they think that at certain point time<br>michael Jackson might have been castrated<br>and that’s why he can sing at such a high pitch<br>even though he’s a grown man<br>and that might be why he’s so fucked up sexually<br>and totally makes sense<br>especially when you look at his children<br>those are not his children I mean they’re white kids<br>they’re 100% white I mean he’s a black man<br>I mean he might have paid<br>for someone to have those kids for him<br>but they’re not his kids<br>you know and I think that<br>it’s real possible<br>that that that’s real possible but it’s speculation<br>yeah but<br>janet and all them all kind of have that kind of voice<br>you know no<br>tito doesn’t germaine doesn’t<br>those are men you look at his brother<br>those are men<br>unless he’s like some sort of a a biological freak<br>why does he have that voice why is he look like that<br>why is he so feminine<br>why is his voice so high pitched<br>even though he’s a grown man<br>I mean could you imagine what if<br>would if I mean he’s so crazy with his<br>fucking plastic surgery<br>what if he had some<br>bad sexual experiences when he was younger<br>and he just decided to castrate himself<br>I mean you look at what he does to his face yeah<br>that’s not beyond the realm of question<br>I’m just making up fucking rumors that works at<br>2h in 5min this is the goddamn rumor show folks<br>what is that<br>this is my anger to one of these Twitter posters<br>I love those guys that just like someone get mad<br>there’s like those<br>guys that just like trying to get your attack<br>hey look at me<br>look at me like every five post<br>it’s the same guy castrated<br>ben can’t get hard man<br>oh can get hard man<br>uh they can trust me I know that’s what he said<br>how do you know<br>I thought that was a whole point castrating people<br>unless you take like<br>you have to take by agricum<br>how does anybody know this is there any<br>dick experts out there on the Twitter<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>please give me some information<br>can you really get a heart on after castrated<br>not by natural means right you have to take something<br>don’t you<br>seems like when the balls are whacked out<br>that’s a rap sun<br>that’s a rap sun<br>some rap sun<br>oh well I’m glad you guys are enjoying it<br>jp j fourp zero<br>this is fun it’s fun for me too man<br>would I bang a 16 year old no man listen<br>you know they look hot that’s the problem<br>and they’re ready to fuck they really are<br>you know what 16 angels I mean I’m not saying<br>anybody should fuck them<br>but when you see a girl<br>like when I was in 16 when I was 16<br>I was having sex weren’t you<br>I was having sex and<br>my girlfriend was 15 and she was built like a woman<br>she looked like a woman<br>she had tits and she had a<br>big ass<br>and it was a woman and she wanted sex all the time<br>I mean that’s<br>that shit is real<br>you know<br>I mean that’s but you’re not supposed to do it<br>doug stanhop has a joke about it me and<br>bryan me and ari were talking about it on the plane<br>ari told me the joke that doug said<br>and apparently doug said you know<br>you say that they<br>they’re 16 years old they shouldn’t be having babies<br>well guess what god disagrees<br>that’s why they can get pregnant<br>and that’s a really good point<br>yeah you know<br>I mean that’s really true<br>but no I wouldn’t have sex with a six year old<br>that’s a child<br>you know even I mean<br>even if a girl’s like 20<br>like I’m 40 fucking 2 years old<br>like I’ve heard of dudes that are like my age<br>that have like 20 year old girlfriends<br>and everybody laughs about it<br>like wow look at that guy’s good so<br>we have a buddy that has a<br>wife and his wife’s 19<br>you know and he’s in his forties<br>it’s crazy but you know what that’s them<br>they they like it and they have a good time to<br>I have a hard time talking to people<br>you know I can’t<br>I mean<br>if I’m gonna live with someone they have to be smart<br>I mean I need someone who has some experience<br>same level you have to be on the same level as me<br>and there’s something that you deny when you’re younger<br>but you realize when you get older<br>is that when you fuck when you have sex with someone<br>even though you like to think that it’s just physical<br>you just get in there<br>you blow a load<br>it’s not that simple<br>there’s some sort of a weird connection<br>that human beings make<br>when they fuck<br>and especially when you do it to someone who’s young<br>like they we learn how to ignore that connection<br>we learn how to like push each other away<br>when we get older we learn how to separate and<br>get you know just deal with it about like physically<br>but when you’re young like you get so attacked<br>you remember how attached to her<br>the first person you had sex with<br>holy shit unless that person’s a total douche bag<br>you know like you like it really like hooked on them<br>like puppy love is brutal<br>you know that’s what they call<br>you’re in experience in the incredible connection and<br>you as you get older<br>you learn how to manage that connection<br>but the connection is real<br>and if you’re a grown adult<br>and you know you’re<br>especially<br>if you’re in a position to take advantage of this kid<br>you know they’re young and naive and silly and<br>you’re fucking them<br>that’s a weird thing you know<br>but then again a lot of 20 year olds are horny as fuck<br>they want some dick<br>I’m not telling you what to do<br>do whatever you want to do<br>but to me<br>when you know<br>girls 18 that’s like a baby to me<br>it’s that’s a little child<br>I like women you know<br>I don’t like them old<br>I don’t even like a my age<br>but<br>it’s women or more fun<br>I don’t like people talk to people don’t you<br>some dude josh jetsu says I’m 23<br>well good for you you young little whippersnapper<br>when I was 23 I was fucking retarded<br>all right I was a complete and total dumbass<br>so I hope you were smarter than me sir<br>because<br>life can be tough when you’re stupid<br>you know<br>and if you it’s we all come from a different place<br>you know we all have a different<br>you know a different starting point<br>that’s what it is you know<br>some people<br>the their parents are super cool and real open<br>and their dads their best friend<br>and you know and their dad was you know<br>very educated and intelligent and<br>raised them you know very<br>in a very smart way<br>and that person is a huge head start<br>huge huge huge head start in life<br>if your parents are cool<br>my parents were divorced when I was a little kid<br>my you know my step dad<br>came into the picture when I was seven he was 24<br>and imagine if you were<br>24 years old and you know<br>actually I was five when he came into picture<br>you were 24 years old and<br>you have a fucking<br>five year old kid hanging around with you<br>you know so if he came in the picture when I was five<br>then he was like 22<br>that’s young as fuck<br>you know to be<br>that young and to be around someone else’s kid<br>someone else’s<br>loud ass kid you know<br>that’s hard to deal with<br>so a lot of you out there<br>maybe you my 23 year old friend<br>maybe you have a head start<br>you know<br>maybe you’ll be smarter than me when you were 23<br>then when I was 23 but I think<br>what I was talking about recently with a friend of mine<br>was that guys like michael Jackson or you know or<br>anybody that I know that’s exceptional<br>almost everybody I know<br>that’s really exceptional and anything<br>had kind of a fucked up childhood<br>and I think that’s really weird<br>you know people that I know that are like<br>all my friends that are like really good comics<br>all my friends that are<br>like really good artists<br>all of them had fucked up childhoods<br>what are you doing show in the beginning thing again<br>show in the beginning thing again yeah<br>that beginning things pretty badass<br>I think you know<br>I think it’s horrible<br>you know that people have fucked up childhoods<br>but I think there’s something<br>something that comes out of that right<br>yeah like when you’re unbalanced it’s like<br>your ride is so much rockier<br>but there’s so much more energy behind it<br>it’s like if you can get a hold of it and<br>control your personality<br>and figure out a way to stabilize it<br>it’s like you have so much more thrust<br>than a person is contempt<br>but it might be unhealthy<br>final words<br>final words listen bitches I know final words<br>yeah take a couple of these

haven’t paged through yet<br>no well I have everything set up so there’s 100 images<br>or 100 posts why<br>am I excited about coming to Toronto<br>have I ever been<br>no I’ve never been a Toronto and I can’t fucking wait<br>your wife is nice tits manipu<br>very nice tits<br>he told me to say that<br>he said tell my wife she has nice tits<br>she does she has nice tits congratulations sir<br>I’m reading the page man<br>you not see<br>he said I’m just seeing if he’s reading the page<br>really you had to say that because<br>you didn’t want to be bragging about your wife’s tits<br>you know<br>what do you say about being drunk is better<br>smoking weed and fucking is just awesome<br>being drunk is better<br>when it comes to eating pussy though<br>really<br>being not in my opinion<br>in my opinion<br>being drunk is better when it comes to eating ass<br>because it’s the only time I<br>do it because I never eat ass when I’m sober<br>the only time you eat ass when you’re sobers<br>when you just get out of jail<br>when you’re high<br>you don’t want to eat an ass either<br>but<br>I don’t eat the fuck out of some pussy with them heart<br>mmm you just you like hit your pants and<br>megan fox ass I’ll eat that any time of it<br>yeah any time of the day eat that ass oh yeah<br>what if it’s all poohie it doesn’t matter<br>you don’t care<br>no you even wipe it off<br>you just dive in there<br>oh you wipe it off with your mouth<br>I’ll start with the hair<br>well that’s why I think it’s important to drink<br>drinking the reason why drinking and eating<br>ass goes in hand in hand is the alcohol kills the e<br>coli I mean<br>when you’re drinking<br>jack and cokes and you’re eating ass<br>the alcohol is killing any bad bacteria<br>that alcohol is<br>flushed your whole system<br>with poison nothing’s growing in that<br>no no bacteria is gonna take hold<br>it’s gonna get swallowed up and that whole antiseptic<br>chemical reaction that the jack and coke has<br>that’s why<br>you really think you can eat ass when you’re<br>jack and coke<br>when you’re high you don’t want to eat ass<br>because when you’re high like this is<br>how we not the best idea<br>it’s like frog<br>you know where you put like metal in there and it<br>cleans the metal did you see know that<br>what if you take jewelry and put it in a can of coke<br>it just dissolves all this shit<br>it’s a coke in a frog<br>yeah if you take put a frog in a<br>thing of coke like a dead frog<br>it just eats all the skin away<br>it just bone makes it bone<br>is that true folks or is that one of those<br>those<br>dangerous because I heard that<br>the taking the paint off cars was bullshit<br>is that bullshit<br>I don’t think snopes anyone<br>do you know<br>one of the best things to clean your grill is coke<br>really yeah<br>damn in a rag<br>but you know what<br>the doctors when you having like a fucking<br>barbecue sandwich<br>a nice goddamn cold coke it’s pretty fucking delicious<br>right so barbecue pork pulled pork sandwich mmm<br>mmm all right ladies and gentlemen<br>I think that’s gonna be the end<br>we’re gonna take one more question<br>so we end on a high note<br>but we are enjoying the fuck out of this<br>here’s this the disclosure product has 400 witnesses<br>proving et life exists<br>even astronauts listen<br>just because you have 400 people<br>saying that they’ve seen ufos<br>that does not mean there’s ufos<br>that means you have 400 people that<br>say they’ve seen ufos<br>and they might really believe they’ve seen ufos<br>but you know they have a real problem<br>and hunters have a real problem<br>and this<br>happens all over the world where<br>the most experienced hunters<br>are the ones that wind up accidentally killing people<br>and the reason being is that these guys are<br>your experience hunter<br>you know that sometimes your window of opportunity<br>where you get a shot at<br>a deer is real short<br>you gotta be able to react<br>the deer’s right there through the juice tongue<br>you gotta be able to shoot and people<br>see things that aren’t there<br>and one of the things they all say<br>universally when they have an accident<br>and these are like good people<br>church going people no anger no violence issues<br>guys are just love hunting<br>they say they swear they saw a deer<br>they swear they saw a deer<br>one guy accidentally shot this<br>this woman in Maine and she had white mittens on<br>and he was following a deer<br>and this lady was in the woods<br>and she had her white mittens on<br>and he saw that white<br>and he said he saw the buck<br>he said he saw it<br>he said it was right there in front of him<br>and he said he squeezed off the trigger<br>we don’t fully understand how<br>the our consciousness and our imagination<br>affects what we see<br>it’s still very much<br>there’s something tricky to it<br>hallucinations<br>and the ability to see things that aren’t there<br>that’s real and if someone’s in a very heightened state<br>if they’re in a very heightened state<br>like if they’re in the heightened state of<br>wanting to see a deer<br>or if they’re in the heightened state<br>of being in the woods in the dark<br>and you think you see a monster<br>you can see a fucking monster<br>you can really see it<br>you can convince yourself that you’ve actually seen it<br>if you see something<br>and you don’t know what it is<br>you will turn it into your mind and make it a monster<br>if you’re out in the woods and it’s pitch black<br>and you stumble into a wild boar<br>and you barely see it<br>and it makes noise and runs away<br>you could it could be some<br>you know too fucking<br>foot tall troll man with you know<br>giant fucking furry feet and glowing eyes<br>you could make something up in your head<br>and you don’t think you’re doing it<br>but you’re doing it<br>the human imagination<br>and human memory are not totally to be trusted<br>so unless they have actual evidence<br>listening to anybody talk about ufos<br>you have to listen to them and go<br>hmm maybe maybe<br>I’m not saying that you can’t get<br>you know here from other planets<br>I mean if you are<br>so sophisticated<br>that you can travel to this world from another<br>galaxy or another solar system<br>why<br>wouldn’t you be so sophisticated that you could hide<br>why wouldn’t you be so sophisticated<br>your ufo is completely invisible<br>why wouldn’t you be totally undetectable<br>why wouldn’t you mean maybe they would just have<br>everything completely mastered<br>the idea that<br>you know they would<br>show themselves<br>and look like they’re dangling on a strength<br>allow people to take pictures<br>and you know and they maybe they wanted us to see them<br>really and that’s how they did it<br>they just showed up in some<br>weird obscure place where you know<br>no no come on man no that’s not what they’re doing<br>if there really are aliens they’re probably<br>so alien you can’t even recognize them<br>they’re probably<br>I think<br>that what we recognize is what we see in our dimension<br>what we see in our environment<br>what we see in our world<br>I think there’s probably life forms out there<br>there exists that are so alien to us<br>we don’t even have the senses to detect them<br>you know and the way I talked about this before<br>and I always talk about farts<br>and that by when someone farts<br>if you don’t have a nose you have no idea it stinks<br>there’s literally something<br>going around you that’s invisible<br>and this sense that you have tunes into it<br>how do we not know<br>that there are an infinite amount of things<br>that we cannot detect<br>that are around us all the time<br>we don’t it’s just guesswork because<br>something’s not on the same frequency as us<br>something’s not solid it’s not<br>tangible you can’t bang on it because<br>just because of that doesn’t mean it’s not real<br>and if there are aliens they’re probably<br>so fucking alien<br>you can’t even see them<br>they’re probably<br>on a totally different frequency than we are<br>I’m not<br>buying all these dudes that say they’ve seen ufos<br>because they really want to see ufos<br>these motherfuckers want to see it<br>they have all<br>had experiences and something’s happened to them<br>but they want to see ufos<br>they want so bad they’ve given up on their jobs<br>they’ve given up on their careers<br>they’ve decided to pursue ufology full time<br>they make YouTube videos constantly<br>they do conferences in seminars<br>they have a lot of vested interest involved in the idea<br>of flying saucers<br>and ships from other planets coming to this earth<br>and there’s a lot of psychological<br>things you have to take into consideration<br>like why these people want to see these things<br>and when these experiences happen<br>that’s another thing<br>people have individual experiences<br>especially alien abduction experiences<br>most of those things come in the middle of the night<br>while people are dreaming<br>and when you’re dreaming in the middle of the night<br>your brain is producing all<br>sorts of psychedelic chemicals<br>including dmt<br>the most potent psychedelic known to man is produced<br>when you’re in heavy ram sleep<br>so when these people are having<br>these alien abduction experiences<br>how do you not know that it’s not your imagination<br>mixed in<br>with psychedelic drugs that you don’t even know<br>you’re having<br>you’re having<br>these things and your brain is producing them<br>and you’re having these incredible fucking<br>psychedelic trips<br>and maybe you’re halfway into a dream and you wake up<br>and you’re still<br>tripping out of these chemicals in your fucking brain<br>and you start creating<br>all these scenarios with your imagination<br>next thing you know you’re on a spaceship<br>why because you’re in<br>the middle of a fucking natural dmt trip<br>and if you smoke dmts dumb people that want money joe<br>actually there’s some people that aren’t dumb though<br>there’s some people<br>that aren’t dumb that have real experiences<br>you know I’ve seen their interviews I’ve read stuffed<br>I’ve read all the john macbooks<br>john mac tension horrors some of them yes<br>they vary there’s no one<br>you can’t generalize<br>when people have had ufo experiences<br>but any<br>any supernatural phenomenal<br>you know out of the ordinary experience<br>has to be considered<br>in all sorts of different ways<br>where’s the evidence and what else could it have been<br>and when you look at<br>what time these things are taken place<br>almost universally<br>they take place late at night when people<br>especially alien abduction experiences<br>almost universally take place late at night<br>and when these people<br>have these experiences they’re all like sleeping<br>you know they’re all like half out of it<br>and something happens to them<br>it’s much more<br>likely an indogenous dump of psychedelic chemicals<br>ladies and gentlemen I’m no expert my disclaimer<br>I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about<br>this is all shit that I’ve read on the internet<br>and wash documentaries on<br>and<br>learned when I was in my isolation tag<br>stoned<br>we’ve had a good time here today<br>brian did you have a good time<br>50% of their time 50% of time<br>what what didn’t you like about today<br>I’ve heard a lot of you before<br>yes that’s the problem<br>when these subjects come up a lot of times<br>I’ve said<br>I’ve talked about all this shit many times before<br>but brian has to realize there’s a lot of people<br>out there that have not<br>seen me talk about all these things before<br>and when<br>interesting subjects like this come up<br>you know you gotta<br>you gotta address it you know<br>I think it’s their important things talk about<br>but we had a good fucking time<br>thank you very much<br>we’re gonna do this every week<br>like I said I upgraded my internet today<br>finally it’s up so now I can get brian<br>here beside us and we can load videos up and shit<br>and like I said behind us<br>we’re gonna put up a green screen<br>and<br>when we put up the green screen we’re gonna be able to<br>have like a space background shit and<br>I got all kinds of cool things coming on<br>and we’re gonna do this every week<br>fuck it it’s fun I enjoy it<br>next week I’m going to try to bring on my board<br>joey diaz maybe eddie bravo will join us as well<br>maybe ari chaffeer will join us we might have a<br>whole party in here<br>because<br>next week I’m going to have a big couch in here<br>so thank you very much<br>I had a good time you motherfuckers<br>if you<br>want to come see me do stand up if you’re in Miami<br>I’m at the<br>Lincoln theater in Miami on the 20 seconds<br>which is I think it’s next Saturday next Friday<br>next Friday next Friday next Friday<br>so
