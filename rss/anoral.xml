    <title>An Oral History of The Office</title>
    <link>https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/5T1519uHGVd6Te2xF5tKkR</link>
    <description>Fifteen years ago, the American television landscape changed forever with the launch of a new series that struggled initially, but became one of television’s most beloved and enduring comedies. “An Oral History of The Office” pulls back the curtain on what went into creating this unstoppable force in American popular culture and why it continues to resonate with new audiences today. Hosted by Brian Baumgartner (Kevin Malone) and produced by Propagate Content, the podcast features interviews with the cast and creators from The Office and reveals some never-before-heard stories from the people who were there from the very beginning. </description>
