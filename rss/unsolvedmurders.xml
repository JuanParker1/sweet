On February 14th, 1945, a 74-year-old Farmhand named Charles Walton was brutally slain in the nearby village of Lower Quinton. Scotland Yard deployed master detective Robert Fabian to lead the investigation. But what he hoped would be an open-and-shut case soon revealed itself to be an impenetrable web, made only murkier by centuries of superstition. From the outset, the case seemed to be cursed, whether by the phantom hounds that traipsed the countryside, or by the whispers of witchcraft and black magic that followed whenever anyone spoke of Charles Walton.Sponsors!Bombas - Save 20% on your first purchase when you shop at Bombas.com/UNSOLVED!
