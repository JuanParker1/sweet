That is until someone from her past resurfaced, searching for justice. For the last three years, investigative journalist Habiba Nosheen has been trying to find out what happened to Nuseiba. But some people want the truth to stay hidden.</description>

People were convinced that there was an underground network of satanists abusing children right under their noses, and everyone was a suspect. Children who were taken away for questioning often didn't return. Parents, friends, and neighbors were arrested without evidence to support the charges. In the midst of this frenzy, one family packed their bags and made a break for it. In this episode, what it’s like to try to outrun a panic. Learn more about your ad choices.

It was the one issue that could unite even the most disparate factions of society, from radical leftists to Christian conservatives. But the movement to protect children quickly morphed into an all-consuming panic that pushed parents, therapists, and police to view all children as victims—even if the children claimed otherwise.  Learn more about your ad choices.

In it, a woman named Michelle describes satanic rituals she was forced to participate in as a child. She “recovered” these memories with the help of her psychotherapist, who coined the term ritual abuse. In this episode, we track how the idea of satanic ritual abuse jumped from the pages of a suspicious book into police departments across North America. Learn more about your ad choices.

He had come to believe that his dad Melvin was the murderous leader of a satanic cult. It would be decades before John would learn that his family was just one of many swept up in a panic that gripped America in the 1980s—one in which hundreds of people were accused of taking part in underground satanic cults that sacrificed infants and sexually abused children. By the time the panic had subsided, scores of people were in prison, convicted on little to no evidence—people like John's father. Conviction: American Panic takes you inside one of the darkest and most bizarre chapters of American history.Conviction: American Panic premieres February 25.

      <title>Conviction: Season 1 Trailer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/59xz4YOmlKrKTM2kvKZPrs?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="232" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>Manny Gomez is a detective straight out of a detective novel. He carries a pen that’s really a knife, wears a watch that’s really a camera, adores Sherlock Holmes and Miami Vice. But the cases Manny takes on are all too real: cases of young men in New York City who say they’ve been arrested for crimes they didn’t commit. In the first season of Conviction, reporter Saki Knafo follows Manny as he tackles the biggest case of his career—and along the way, Saki explores big questions about criminal justice in America. This story is the first in Gimlet Media’s Conviction series, which will feature a new piece of investigative reporting each season.
