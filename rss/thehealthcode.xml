Our bodies are sensitive to what time of the month it is. There are weeks where you can - and should - go all out with cardio and heavy lifting, while there's also a period of time when you need to slow down, recover and give your body some rest through long walks and stretching.

Adding in deprivation of food according to the chosen fasting window can add on to an already elevated stress level - which can actually be counterproductive to what we're trying to achieve.
