    <title>Crimes of Passion</title>
    <link>https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/5PFgy6lc8UvYIjDsaaO3dN</link>
    <description>Every Wednesday, we tell a love story that turns into a crime story. Our subjects might start as lovers, friends, or family, but by the end, there's a criminal and a victim. Along the way, we analyze the relationship dynamics and psychology that lead to betrayal, theft, and even murder. Crimes of Passion is part of the Parcast Network, and a production of Cutler Media.</description>
