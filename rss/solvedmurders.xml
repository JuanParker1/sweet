    <link>https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/4t4nuhMponRkNpX6xKFVNZ</link>
    <description>To commemorate our fourth anniversary, Parcast and the team behind Unsolved Murders are taking a closer look at what it takes to catch a killer. In the new series Solved Murders: True Crime Mysteries, you'll follow the clues and uncover the missing pieces to some of history's most gripping cases. Every Wednesday, join hosts Carter and Wenndy as they explore the days, months, and even years leading up to a killer being caught. Each episode plays out like a classic murder mystery—where the final reveal is nearly as shocking as the murder itself. Solved Murders: True Crime Mysteries is a Spotify Original from Parcast.</description>

      <description><![CDATA[ <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5nKmiirwZSGdy5YG3LzNnR?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="232" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>Every murder case has clues: an errant fingerprint, a spatter of blood, a forgotten bullet casing. But these investigations can go awry. Clues disappear, trails go cold, and cases are reduced to nothing more than files forgotten in a police precinct basement. But on Parcast’s newest series, you’ll explore a different kind of case. Join hosts Carter Roy and Wenndy Mackenzie, and the entire team that brought you Unsolved Murders as they dive into investigations where the clues never run dry, and the story doesn’t stop until the crime is solved. Starting June 10th, join us on Solved Murders: True Crime Mysteries. Listen for free exclusively on Spotify where new episodes are released every Wednesday. Learn more about your ad choices.
