But strangely, “Hell of a Life” is in many ways a journey toward self-acceptance. Kanye exposes the darkest recesses of his imagination, an honest assessment of his most private thoughts. And the more honest Kanye is about himself, the more alienated and shunned from the world he becomes. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</p> ]]></description>

We dissect the iconic opening piano line, examining its conscious use of overtones and rhythmic deception.After deconstructing the song’s beat, we turn to its lyrics and Kanye’s cathartic embrace of his imperfections.

We’ll hear this thematically in the song’s lyrics, but also tonally in the song’s unresolved, contrasting chord structure.At the conclusion of our episode, we’ll display how the song’s abrupt ending sets up the album’s next track “Runaway.” Things take an unexpected turn we realize how inexorably linked the two tracks are both thematically and tonally.

Everything about the track contributes to its monstrous theme. The production rumbles and shakes with a persistent, driving low end and minimal treble. There’s use of multiple sound effects, including literal monster roars, screams, and detuned voices.Kanye also selects guest artists and coaxes them to staying on theme: Justin Vernon’s distorted, sinister introduction, Rick Ross’s grisly, monstrous voice, Jay-Z’s clever wordplay, and of course, Nicki Minaj’s alter-ego invested verse, which many argue to be the best verse of the entire decade.

This kind of problematic indulgence is an inherent quality of celebrity, and “All of the Lights” is calculated overstimulation, a sensory overload aimed to express the strung-outed-ness of a life lived beneath a perpetual spotlight.Structurally, “All of the Lights” acts as a bridge into another world. While there’s been moments of fantasy in the album’s first three songs, on “All of the Lights” we hear for the first time an elaborate fantasy world created throughout an entire song, complete with its own narrative arc. It begins a glamorous, ambitious ode to stardom and ends a dysfunctional, unraveling mess. It’s an ongoing expression of the internal conflict and dichotomy Kanye feels within himself, forever torn between the justification of his greatness and his apparent internal insecurity and sensitivity following the VMAs, his mother’s death, and his failed engagement.

Kanye simultaneously explores power both as a concept in and of itself, as well as its personal affects on his life and mind. It’s something Kanye clearly struggles with. He’s smart enough to recognize power’s ability to deteriorate his spirit, but also recognizes his own inability to let it go. Learn more about your ad choices.

There’s nary a wasted word on “Gorgeous” as Kanye seamlessly weaves cheeky pop culture references with poignant racial anecdotes and self-empowering affirmations. It’s a blueprint to atonement, to overcoming uncontrollable forces with sheer grit, determination, and self-assurance. Kanye seems less concerned with how to end racism and more concerned with how to overcome it, how to do great things in spite of it.Layers of emotional and psychological complexity are added when we consider the song’s hook, an observation on Kanye’s psyche after the VMA backlash. It subtly reveals that fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of losing it all are guiding, underlying principles in Kanye’s behavior. It would seem for all his bravado, Kanye is not fully confident in his confidence, his ego a defense mechanism to adversity. Learn more about your ad choices.

It’s a beautiful amalgamation of soul, hip-hop, RnB, classical, and gospel, at once seamless and juxtaposed, and utterly grandiose.Lyrically, we find Kanye at perhaps his most economical. Woven within just two compact verses and a brief bridge, Kanye establishes a complex character who appears confident and living a luxurious life of fame and fortune. But veiled beneath the surface is a struggle between good and evil, someone who is all too aware of the shallowness of the drugs, sex, and materialism he indulges in.

But we must remember the larger goal: to provide context, to get a basic understanding of the trajectory of Kanye’s musical output and success. We’ll cherry-pick a song or two from each album that’s representative of Kanye’s production and lyrical subject matter at that particular time, gaining a broad sense of the evolution of Kanye’s art leading up to our main course, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.

His using a live version is a strategic, self-referential appropriation, the reasons for which become clear when the performance comes to a halt after a fight breaks out in the crowd, and Kendrick recites a spoken word piece that puts an end to the scuffle.The statement “Kendrick Lamar, by far, the realest negus alive” at the end of the spoken word piece is the album’s exclamation mark, the moment of triumph, the one-liner in the movie that signals the hero has finally conquered the villain.  Learn more about your ad choices.

This early version, which we’ll refer to as the “studio version,” does not appear on the album. Instead, a live performance of “i” is used. Because Kendrick uses “i” self-referentially as a climactic narrative tool, we’re going to first use the studio version to examine the song’s thematic content. In Part 2, we’ll cross-examine the live version as it appears on the album. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</p> ]]></description>

He calls out Kendrick for never answering his phone, dressing differently, and forgetting about his friends.The voicemail triggers Kendrick’s survival’s guilt for escaping Compton. Earlier on the album, Kendrick was sent into a fit of manic depression by his survival’s guilt on the song “u.” On “Hood Politics,” Kendrick attempts to convince himself of the street credibility he’s earned as a youth in Compton, and how he’s remained true to his roots despite his success.

On his first return, he gloated about his success and status on the song “King Kunta.” This time around Kendrick shows signs of maturation. He’s reflective, nostalgic. Having been through the trauma of “u” and the hypnotic seduction of “For Sale?,” home is now a place of grounding comfort that helps Kendrick in his search for clarity and contentment.On verse three, Kendrick returns to another, more metaphoric home: Africa. He recounts an experience in South Africa in which he feels an inert kinship with a boy there. It forces Kendrick to reconsider his entire identity and sends him spinning into an existential crisis that’s reflected in the song’s abstract outro. Learn more about your ad choices.

(Interlude).”Whereas the album’s second track “For Free?” was an external reaction to the seductive lures of Uncle Sam, the American Dream incarnate, “For Sale?” is the internal reaction to seductive lures of Lucy, the Devil incarnate.The contrast of “For Free?” and “For Sale?” starts to reveal the intricacies of the album’s overall narrative structure. While we’ve seen examples of the contrasting duality theme on a small scale in individual songs, we’ll now begin to see it appear in large scale between entire songs.“For Sale?” takes place in Kendrick’s subconscious while he dreams. The majority of the song is told from the perspective of Lucy as she recounts the first time her and Kendrick met. It turns out, Lucy and Uncle Sam have a lot in common. Both attempt to pray on Kendrick’s naivety for their own selfish benefits. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</p> ]]></description>

The song’s simple message of hope through solidarity and resilience has struck a chord with supporters of the movement, and the refrain “we gon be alright” has been heard chanted at protests and rallies across the country.

It interweaves a complex threesome between Kendrick, an unnamed woman, and an imprisoned man serving a life sentence. Each deals with their own personal set of constricting walls that work to prohibit personal progress.Upon first listen, “These Walls” is a similar experience to “King Kunta.” It’s so infectiously danceable and enjoyable that the intricacies of the story it tells is easily lost. But this only works to exemplify Kendrick’s extraordinary talent to craft radio-ready singles without sacrificing the album’s narrative or its ability to stand on its own under scrutiny. It’s only after thorough examination that one realizes its intricacies. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</p> ]]></description>

It begins with Institutionalized, a bouncing, head-nodding track that details Kendrick’s frustrations with his Compton friends’ behavior at the BET awards.By naming the song "Institutionalized," Kendrick alludes to broader issues that plague our country and manifest in the behavior of the impoverished and repressed population. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the recent trend of athletes, musicians, and entertainers using their influence to shed light on social issues is evidence that perhaps many celebrities are more aware of the potential of their platforms.

On its surface, King Kunta is boastful, heroic, prideful, and at times, vain. Upon further examination, however, we’ll realize there’s a deeper, contrasting message to the song’s calculated, overtly valiant air. We’ll also discover that “King Kunta” is the pinnacle of the album’s first act, which we’ve named Pimped by Consumption. Learn more about your ad choices.

We also meet the album’s antagonist, Uncle Sam, who looks to exploit young Kendrick for profit.Through the lens of this song, we’ll cover topics like the American Dream in modern society, the origins of the phrase “40 Acres and a mule”, Dave Chapelle’s exit from his hit TV show, and Wesley Snipes’ tax evasion conviction.We’ll also examine how Wesley’s Theory is written cinematically and sets the stage for the narrative that unfolds throughout To Pimp a Butterfly.
