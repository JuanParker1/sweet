    <title>Stolen: The Search for Jermain</title>
    <link>https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/7D4inq4DY144KIZN99Od6t</link>
    <description>In 2018, a young Indigenous mother named Jermain Charlo left a bar in Missoula, Montana, and was never seen again. After two years and thousands of hours of investigative work, police believe they are close to solving the mystery of what happened to her. We go inside the investigation, tracking down leads and joining search parties through the dense mountains of the Flathead Reservation. As we unravel this mystery, the show examines what it means to be an Indigenous woman in America.</description>

Nobody seems to know what happened to Nuseiba Hasan. She’s a Jordanian-Canadian woman, who, in 2006, suddenly vanished without a trace. That is until someone from her past resurfaced, searching for justice. For the last three years, investigative journalist Habiba Nosheen has been trying to find out what happened to Nuseiba. But some people want the truth to stay hidden. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices</p> ]]></description>
