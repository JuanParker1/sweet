    <description>Welcome to a world where fairy tales do exist, and “once upon a time” is closer, darker, and more dangerous than you imagined. Welcome to the immersive new Parcast original series, Faerie. Available exclusively on Spotify, Faerie follows the investigation of Ryan Bailey—a young woman, who by happenstance, saves a man’s life and is thrust into a secret world of mythological creatures called “faeries.” Join Ryan as she unearths more about their mysterious existence and the covert agency charged with protecting them. This 12-episode event is brought to you in partnership with Public Radio Alliance. Faerie is a Spotify Original from Parcast.</description>
