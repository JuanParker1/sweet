    <title>Medical Murders</title>
    <link>https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/3cY3fxs68qyfXxnqILRns6</link>
    <description>We all know that medical professionals are trained to give exceptional care. But what about those who use their skills not to heal, but hurt? In the Parcast Original, Medical Murders, you’ll discover a disturbing diagnosis… that not every doctor wants to extend your life. Every Wednesday, meet the worst the medical community has to offer—men and women who took an oath to save lives, but instead, used their expertise to develop more sinister specialties. Join host Alastair Murden, as he examines the formative years and motives of history’s most infamous killer doctors, dissecting their medical backgrounds with expert analysis provided by practicing M.D., Dr. David Kipper. Medical Murders is a Spotify Original from Parcast.</description>
